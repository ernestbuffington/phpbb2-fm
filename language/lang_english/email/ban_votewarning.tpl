Subject: You have received a warning
Charset: iso-8859-1

Hello {WARNED_POSTER}, 

Your account on "{SITENAME}" has recived a ban vote. 
You have now a total of {VOTEBANWARNINGS} ban votes, if you receive more than {TOTAL_VOTEBANWARN} your account will be blocked. 

The reasons for this are numerous, but this ban vote was issued from this post: 
{POST_URL} 
that you made, but this may or may not be the reason behind the banvote. 

This vote does not reflect the opinions or views of the administrators or moderators of this forum unless of course they personally placed the banvote themselves (though, you would receive a warning or be straight-out banned by these people, not receive a banvote).
