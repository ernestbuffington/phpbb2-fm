 *	This is the admin language file for the Page Permissions MOD from
 * 	the phpBBDoctor.com. The external language file was added in version
 *	1.0.2 to dramatically cut down on the number of actual file edits
 *	required to install / upgrade this MOD. By externalizing the language
 *	file it will make it very easy to provide translations.
 *
 *	If you are a translator and would like to translate this file I will
 *	happily host it at www.phpBBDoctor.com. Send me a PM at www.phpbb.com
 *	with your information and I will give you instructions on how and 
 *	where to send me the file(s).
