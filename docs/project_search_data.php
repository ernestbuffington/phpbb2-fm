These extras include: config.php/config_backup.php desktop.php/desktop_body.tpl (Desktop Plus) root_redirect_to_directory_portal.html .htaccess erc.php (Emergency Recovery Console) login.php _fix_user_usergroups.php _fix_no_posts.php cookie.php config.php/config_backup.php Spare configuration files are included in case of accidents. config_backup.php is a standard phpBB configuration file that just requires database name, user, and password data added to restore a deleted or misplaced original. Open config_backup.php and edit the database details to suit your site. Rename the file to config.php and move it to the root directory of your forum, e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/phpBB2/config.php desktop.php/desktop_body.tpl (Desktop Plus) Desktop Plus allows your users to add a latest posts window to your forums that loads on their desktop without having to open up a browser. It will scroll the latest posts as if the user was logged in, providing the user hasn \'t cleared their cookies. They can click on any topic and be linked directly to it. Admin Instructions for Setup Move desktop.php to forum root directory. Move desktop_body.tpl to ALL style directories (make duplicate copies for extra styles). Post instructions for your users (see below). User Instructions for Setup Right-click on your desktop. Select \'Properties \'. Click on the \'Customize Desktop \' button. Click on the \'Web \' tab. Click on where it says \'new \' (next to a list of webpages). Add the following location http://yourdomain.com/phpBB2/desktop.php (make sure you click on the checkbox next to the address after you add it to the list). Click \'OK \' on all windows. Resize desktop window to suit your preference. root_redirect_to_directory_portal.html This file enables Fully Modded phpBB to detect whether visitors are browsing using browsing agents or mobile devices, and will redirect them accordingly. Open root_redirect_to_directory_portal.html and edit the domain names to suit your site. Rename the file to index.html and move it to the root directory of your server, e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/index.html .htaccess This file enables Fully Modded phpBB to detect and redirect visitors (on arrival) to the portal before the forum index. Move .htaccess to your forum root directory. login.php This file allows your users to be redirected back to the portal after logging in/out instead of the forum index. Move login.php to your forum root directory, overwriting the existing login.php file. _fix_user_usergroups.php This script is provided to fix a known bug with phpBB 2 and its Usergroups. See error messages caused by this bug Here . Move _fix_user_usergroups.php to your forum root directory and execute it through your browser, e.g. http://yourdomain.com/phpBB2/_fix_user_usergroups.php. _fix_no_posts.php This script is provided to fix a problem that may arise after updating to a newer version. If your board style is not set back to subSilver and all users overriden before you update, some users may recieve a \'No posts exist for this topic \' error message, when clearly posts do exist. This script will attempt to change all users to the default subSilver style. Move _fix_no_posts.php to your forum root directory and execute it through your browser, e.g. http://yourdomain.com/phpBB2/_fix_no_posts.php. erc.php (Emergency Recovery Console) This script is an Emergency Recovery Console (ERC), which can be used to access the board even when the normal methods of phpBB fail. You can clear the session table, reset path, cookie, language or template data, clear the ban list, remove administrator accounts, garant an user admin privileges or recreate the config.php. Thus, the ERC can be helpful when you have problems with the session handling, removed a template in error or your board was hacked. Move erc.php to the admin/ directory. SECURITY NOTE: You can gain access to the complete board by using the ERC. Although you need at least the password of the database to do so, it is reccommended to use this file only when necessary or to secure the admin directory with a password at least if you decide to leave this file in the admin directory. cookie.php This script automatically detects and writes proper domain name and cookie settings. This is a run once and delete script that will help you resolve many problems, including login issues. Move cookie.php to your forum root directory and execute it through your browser, e.g. http://yourdomain.com/phpBB2/cookie.php.",6),array(3,"install_new.html","2005-11-25","FULLY MODDED PHPBB 2 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION","","","New Installation Installation of Fully Modded phpBB will vary according to your server and database. If you have shell access to your account (via telnet or ssh for example) you may want to upload the entire Fully Modded phpBB archive (in binary mode!) to a directory on your host and unarchive it there. If you do not have shell access or do not wish to use it you will need to decompress the Fully Modded phpBB archive to a local directory on your system using your favourite compression program, e.g. winzip, rar, zip, etc. From there you must FTP ALL the files it contains (being sure to retain the directory structure and filenames) to your host. Please ensure that the cases of filenames are retained, do NOT force filenames to all lower or upper case doing so will cause errors later. All .php, .inc, .sql, .cfg and .htm files should be uploaded in ASCII mode, while all graphics should be uploaded in BINARY mode. If you are unfamiliar with what this means please refer to your FTP client documentation. In most cases this is all handled transparantly by your ftp client but if you encounter problems later you should be sure the files where uploaded correctly as described here. Fully Modded phpBB comes supplied with English as its standard language. However a number of seperate packs for different languages are available. If you are not a native English speaker you may wish to install one or more of these packages before continuing. The installation process below will allow you to select a default language from those available (you can of course change this default at a later stage). Once all the files have been uploaded to your site you should point your browser at this location with the addition of install/install.php (please note that if you changed the extension from php below, you should alter install.php appropriately). For example if your domain name is www.yourdomain.com and you placed Fully Modded phpBB in a directory /phpBB2 off your web root you would enter http://www.yourdomain.com/phpBB2/install/install.php into your browser. When you have done this you should see the Fully Modded phpBB Installation screen appear. Changing the file extension If the file extension used to execute PHP scripts on your server is NOT .php but for example .php3 or .phtml you should first rename ALL files ending in .php and change the value of phpEx in extension.inc . In the vast majority of cases this step will be unncessary. i. Installing on MySQL Before proceeding with installation you should ensure you have a database available. Most good hosting accounts now come with at least one database as part of the basic package although it may need to be setup before first use. Ask your provider for details if you are unsure whether you do or not. If you are running your own server and are unsure how to create a database you should refer to your SQL servers documentation or website, e.g. http://www.mysql.com/doc/ . ii. Entering required data Once you have reached the installation page you need to fill out several fields. If you do not have or do not know the database name , database server , etc. please check with your hosting provider. For non-ODBC databases the database server is typically localhost but this is NOT universal! The database prefix allows you to enter a few characters, short name, etc. which all tables used by this installation will be prefixed with. The default (phpbb_) will usually be fine. However if you have more than one copy of Fully Modded phpBB using the same database be sure to alter it or you will receive errors during installation. The remaining information is personal to you and your site. You will need to enter a username and password for the initial administration account (more administrators can be created later). The server name , server port and script path are essential because all emails containing URLs will use these values. The installer will guess initial values, however they may not be correct so be sure to check them! Remember that a domain (or server) name does NOT include http://! Enter just the domain name, eg. www.yourdomain.com and NOT http://www.youromain.com/ . The server port can, in the great majority of cases be left as 80, this is the standard http port. However if your web server listens to a different port because for example port 80 is blocked then alter this appropriately. The script path is the relative path from your webroot (/public_html/ directory) where Fully Modded is installed, e.g. if you install Fully Modded into a phpBB2/ directory in your webroot then enter /phpBB2/ as the script path. However, if you install directly into the webroot directory then enter just a backslash ( / ) as the script path. iii. Completing installation Once you have checked all the data press submit. The installation script will create and populate all the necessary tables. It will then attempt to write to the config.php file which will contain the basic configuration data used to run Fully Modded phpBB. If the installer cannot write config.php directly you will be given the option of either downloading the file or even FTPing it to the correct location. If you choose to download you should then re-upload the file to your server, overwriting the existing config.php in the process. If you attempt to FTP via the install script you should supply the requested information. Should FTP fail you will be able to download the file and then re-upload as described earlier. During the installation procedure Fully Modded phpBB will check to ensure the relevant PHP database module is available and will not proceed if it cannot be found. Should this happen be sure to check you have selected the correct database and/or ask your hosting provider for advice.

Securing & Enabling the Board Once you have successfully installed/updated you MUST DELETE the entire install/ directory. Leaving this in place is a very serious potential security issue which may lead to deletion or alteration of files, etc. Please note that until this directory is removed your board will not operate and the board disabled message will be displayed. With this directory deleted you should proceed to the administration panel. Depending on how the installation/upgrade completed you may have been directed there automatically. If not, login as the administrator you specified during install/upgrade and click the Administration Panel link at the top/bottom of any page. Ensure that details specified in General - Configuration settings are correct! v. Directory permissions Fully Modded phpBB 2 requires some file and directories to have read/write permissions to allow on the server editing, users to upload avatars, photos, attach files, etc. These file and directories permissions must be set manually.	- admin/backup/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- cache/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- cache/tpls/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- cache/reflog.txt	0666 or -rw-rw-rw-	- cache/semaphore.ref	0666 or -rw-rw-rw-	- images/smiles/	0666 or -rw-rw-rw-	- language/*/lang_bbcode.php	0666 or -rw-rw-rw-	- language/*/lang_faq.php	0666 or -rw-rw-rw-	- modules/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- modules/pakfiles/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- pafiledb/cache/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- pafiledb/cache/templates/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- player/remote_getid3/getid3/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- uploads/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- uploads/attachments/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- uploads/attachments/thumbs/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- uploads/album/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- uploads/album/thumbs/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- uploads/user_avatars/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- uploads/user_avatars/tmp/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- uploads/user_photos/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- uploads/pafiledb/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx-	- uploads/pafiledb/screenshots/	0777 or -rwx-rwx-rwx- On UNIX systems for example you set the directory to a+rwx (or ugo+rwx or even 0777). This can be done from a command line on your server using chmod or via your FTP client (using the Change Permissions, chmod or other Permissions dialoge box, see your FTP clients documentation for help). Most FTP clients list permissions in the form of User (Read, Write, Execute), Group (Read, Write, Execute) and Other (Read, Write, Execute). You need to tick all of these boxes to set correct permissions. On Windows system you need to ensure the directory is not write-protected and that it has global write permissions (see your servers documentation or contact your hosting provider if you are unsure on how to achieve this). Please be aware that setting a directories permissions to global write access is a potential security issue. While it is unlikely that anything nasty will occur (such as all the avatars or photos being deleted) there are always people out there out to cause trouble. Therefore you should monitor all these directories and if possible make regular backups of the files contained in them. vi. Required file edit Fully Modded phpBB 2 requires one file to be manually edited. You MUST do the following edit if you wish to enable the mobile device browsing feature. You only have to change the coding that is in red , DO NOT change any other coding. Some file editors will corrupt PHP files so we recommend you use Wordpad, PHP Coder or EmEditor . i. phpBBToGo Edit the file mods/mobile/phpbbtogo.php (Line 291), find and change to the forum_IDs on your board that can be browsed via a mobile device: // The array of forum_IDs to show CFG[ \'mobile_forums \'] = array( 18,24 ); Google Sitemap Setup To setup your board with the Google Sitemap you will need a Google account. If you already have a GMail account, then simply use that username & password. If you don \'t have a GMail account, then get with the times, there \'s plenty of people out there with invites to spare. Once you have a valid Google username & password, go to Google Sitemaps and submit your board URL to google_sitemap.xml . Note: The filename is google_sitemap.php , but a forum root .htaccess file will make google_sitemap.xml load the google_sitemap.php file. e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/google_sitemap.php is submitted as http://www.yourdomain.com/google_sitemap.xml You can load the .xml URL in your browser to check the .htaccess directives are working. Remember though, Google will crawl your site, even if it has a sitemap (apparently), so don \'t worry if not all of your custom URLs are included in the XML files. Uploadable avatars Fully Modded phpBB 2 supports several methods for allowing users to select their own avatar (an avatar is a small image generally unique to a user and displayed just below their username in posts). Two of these options allow users to upload an avatar from their machine or a remote location (via a URL). If you wish to enable this function you should first ensure the correct paths for uploadable avatars is set in Admin - Avatars - Configuration. By default this is uploads/user_avatars but you can set it to whatever you like, just ensure the configuration setting is updated. You must also ensure this directory can be written to by the webserver. Usually this means you have to alter its permissions to allow anyone to read and write to. Exactly how you should do this depends on your FTP client or server operating system. Changes in language pack format and templates Please note that changes have been made to the format of language, image localisations and templates from the previous phpBB/Fully Modded version. If you were running a prior release you will need to download new language and image localisation packs from www.phpbb-fm.com . A number of missing strings have been added which are essential for the new features and functions this new version provides. Please note that at this time not all language packs have been updated so you should be prepared to periodically check for updates. If you are using or have installed any 3rd party template set you must either remove it or update it. Changes have been made to a number of template variables which will result in these not working unless they have been updated to meet the latest Fully Modded phpBB version standards.",7),array(5,"install_pre.html","2006-04-15","FULLY MODDED PHPBB 2 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION","","","System Requirements Installation of Fully Modded phpBB requires the following: A webserver or web hosting account running on any major Operating System PHP (4.4.1 or higher or preferably a recent 5.x) with support for a MySQL database gd library (1.0 or higher or preferably a recent 2.x) FreeType library Register Globals & Safe Mode off/disabled A SQL database system: MySQL (3.23.23 or higher) If your server or hosting account does not meet the requirements above I am afraid Fully Modded phpBB is not for you.

Unfortunately this isn \'t the case. It \'s not that making a language pack is difficult, it \'s actually amazingly easy. So here \'s how you can translate Fully Modded phpBB into your native language. Follow the steps below and you \'ll have a new language on your board before you know it. This tutorial will help you create your own languages so that it is compatible with Fully Modded phpBB 2. Each section is split in to sub sections. To make an existing language you will need a few tools to make the job easier, we recommend the following: Text Editor - e.g. WordPad, EmEditor , or PHP Coder . Graphics Program - e.g. Adobe Photoshop , Paintshop Pro , Gimp , or Fireworks (Photoshop is highly recommended). i. Editing Language Strings The language/ directory of your phpBB install hosts a lang_english/ directory. All you need to do to translate it into French, Dutch, Portuguese, or Somalian is to copy all the files in that folder (including the emails/ directory located in it), rename the copy lang_xxxx (whatever your language is, e.g. lang_french), and then translate away. Example, in your newly created language/lang_xxxx/lang_main.php file you might find: lang[ \'Thankyou \'] = \'Thank you \'; Edit with your text editor to read: lang[ \'Thankyou \'] = \'Merci beaucoup \'; It \'s very important not to change the \'lang[ \'Thankyou \'] \' value! But go ahead and translate everything else into your own language, unless you are specified not to in the file itself. ii. Language Standards All language strings must be inclosed with single quotes/apostrophes ( \'), do not use double quotes/apostrophes (), just don \'t! Example: /* wrong */	lang[ \'who_is \'] = Who is there?;	/* right */	lang[ \'who_is \'] = \'Who is there? \'; All words containing single quotes/apostrophes must be character backslashed ( \\) to avoid parse errors Example: /* wrong */	lang[ \'who_is \'] = \'Who \'s there? \';	/* right */	lang[ \'who_is \'] = \'Who \\ \'s there? \'; iii. Spellchecker Dictionary Translating the spellchecker dictionary into your language is as simple as two easy steps (once complete you will never have to translate this again!) Open the file mods/spellchecker/ENGLISH.txt with a text editor, follow the format of this file and translate it to your language, adding all the words from your language that you would like to see checked by the spellchecker. Once complete save with your language as the filename, e.g. FRENCH.txt, GERMAN.txt. iv. Adding your copyright To add a short copyright message into the footer indicating you are the translator, open the lang_main.php file and add your name. If you are using link urls, please adhere to the default footer copyright text class. Example: // This is optional, if you would like a _SHORT_ message output along with our copyright message indicating you are the translator please add it here.	lang[ \'TRANSLATION_INFO \'] = \'XXX Translation by &lt;a href=http://yourdomain.com target=_blank class=copyright&gt;Name&lt;/a&gt; \'; v. Image Creation Once that \'s done, you \'ll need to make sure you have images in your language. Creating any new/extra images for your new language can be an easy process providing you have the right software. The images/ directory of every theme in your phpBB install hosts a lang_english/ directory containing english images. All you need to do to translate it into French, Dutch, Portuguese, or Somalian is to copy all the files in that folder, rename the copy lang_xxxx (whatever your language is, e.g. lang_french), and then translate away. To translate/create your images you can either: Download the subSilver SDK from phpBB and change the text of the images to suit your language. Use a software package such as Adobe Photoshop and make you own images based on your language. vi. Viewing Finished Products To install your new language upload it to the languages/ directory of your board, either change the overall board language setting, or the language as a user in your profile. Or, you could install both an Apache server and Fully Modded phpBB locally on your machine and have a live view of you language.",6),array(10,"lang_faq.html","2005-11-25","FULLY MODDED PHPBB 2 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION","","","Language FAQ This is a very basic Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section which attempts to answer some of the more commonly asked language questions. Our thanks to all those people who \'ve translated languages, beta tested, contributed bug reports and code fixes in the past. My users are complaining that emails are not in their selected language! You must have deleted a language pack or the language pack is incomplete. phpBB will try to send emails in the users selected language. If it cannot find a suitable email template it will switch to the boards default language. Why do I have to translate my language? Why doesn \'t the support staff do it? Great question! We \'ll ask one in return...Can you put an extra twelve (12) hours in the day? We are all volunteering our time and energy for this free package. Part of the problem is how big Fully Modded phpBB now is...the scope of this project leaves us very little time for anything beyond troubleshooting broken mods or cleaning up after lazy mod owners to make this package function properly. We simply don \'t have time and are not multilingual! It would make more sense for someone fluent in the language to make the language pack! If we had a smaller piece of software, we \'d probably be able to help you.

What do you need in order to run certain features You need the following to use the FTP Upload Feature (Remote and Normal): FTP Extensions built into the PHP Installation. You need the following to create Thumbnails: ImageMagick installed on the Server (you are not able to install this if do not have root administrative access to your server). OR GD Extensions built into the PHP Installation. It is highly recommended to use ImageMagick if it is installed on the server. If the exec() function is not allowed to be called within your PHP Installation, you are unable to use ImageMagick to create thumbnails. 4. Admin Rights or \'Why do you need a User Account \' ? With the Attachment Mod the Administrator has special rights when it comes to attaching Files. The following Restrictions are not taken into account for Admins: Able to exceed the allowed Filesize. Able to attach all allowed and activated Extensions. Able to exceed the maximum Number of Attachments per Post/PM. Able to attach and download files in all forums. Default Quota for Admins is set to the complete Attachment Filesize Quota. If you are testing the Attachment Mod and want to be sure that all Restrictions you have set are actually working, please create a normal User Account for testing. 5. The Attachment Administration Panels 5.1 Control Panel The Control Panel is intended for the Administrator to manage the attached Files, to see some Statistics and search for Attachments. There are four possible Modes that you are able to view at the control panel: Statistics, Search Attachments, Attachments by an particular User and All Attachments. Statistics View: Statistics Search Username Attachments Statistic Value Number of Attachments: 21 Total Filesize: 1.89 MB Attachment Quota: 50 MB Number of Posts with Attachments: 13 Total Number of Attachments in Private Messages: 2 Number of Topics with Attachments: 11 Independent Users Posted Attachments: 3 As you can see, the Statistics gives you a short overview of all posted Attachments. Search Attachments View: Statistics Search Username Attachments Search Attachments Filename: Use * as a wildcard for partial matches File Comment: Use * as a wildcard for partial matches Search for Author: Use * as a wildcard for partial matches Attachment size smaller than (bytes): Attachment size greater than (bytes): Download count is smaller than: Download count is greater than: More than this many days old: Search Options Forum: All available Diskussionen Test1 Test2 Select sort method: Filename Comment Extension Size Downloads Post Time Order: Ascending Descending Very self explanatory, isn \'t it?

You are also able to view each Attachment, delete them or go directly to the Topic where it is posted at. View All Attachments This Panel looks like the Username based Attachments Panel and the one you see after you have searched for an Attachment. The only difference is that you see all Attachments, not only the ones you have searched for or the ones one User has attached. 5.2 Management This Section describes the Administration Panel-&gt;Attachments-&gt;Management Screen. We will go through every configuration option and explain what it means and how it will affect the board. Upload Directory Enter the relative path from your phpBB2 installation to the Attachments upload directory. For example, enter \'uploads/attachments \' if your phpBB2 Installation is located at http://www.yourdomain.com/phpBB2 and the Attachment Upload Directory is located at http://www.yourdomain.com/phpBB2/uploads/attachments. Ok, this Option is for defining your Upload Directory, where your uploaded Files will be placed into. If you use (or want to use) FTP Upload this setting is not needed, the Attachment Mod will use the FTP Settings instead. Please only let the Attachment Mod place files into this Upload Directory, do not upload files for your own into this directory. If you do so, they will be overwritten and the Shadow Attachments Screen will be confused. Examples: Your Website URL for uploaded files: http://www.yoursite.com/phpBB2/uploads/attachments Upload Directory: uploads/attachments Your Website URL for uploaded files: http://www.yoursite.com/uploads Your Website URL to your phpBB2 Board: http://www.yoursite.com/phpBB2 Upload Directory: ./../uploads You see, the Upload Directory is always relative to your phpBB2 Directory. Of course you are able to set absolute pathstoo, but you have to know the \'complete \' directory (and not URL) then. Attachment Posting Icon This Image is displayed next to Attachment Links in individual Postings. Leave this field empty if you don \'t want an icon to be displayed. This Setting will be overwritten by the Settings in Extension Groups Management. The Attachment Posting Icon is a little Image displayed beside links to Attachments within Posts and Private Messages. This setting defines the default Image, if you define Posting Icons for Extension Groups, this default Setting will not be used, onlyfor those Extension Groups with an undefined Icon. The Path is relative to your phpBB2 Directory. Attachment Topic Icon This Image is displayed before topics with Attachments. Leave this field empty if you don \'t want an icon to be displayed. The Attachment Topic Icon is for defining a little Image displayed in front of topics containing Attachments. It is not only for displayingwithin viewforum, it will be displayed within the Moderation Control Panel and the Private Message Box too. Attachment Display Order Here you can choose whether to display the Attachments in Posts/PMs in Descending Filetime Order (Newest Attachment First) or Ascending Filetime Order (Oldest Attachment First). Descending Ascending This Setting is for defining the Ordering of Attachments within Posts and Private Messages. This affects only those Postsand Private Messages with more than one Attachment. For ordering, the Time the Attachment got uploaded is used and not the time thePost was made. Filesize Maximum filesize for Attachments. A value of 0 means \'unlimited \'. This Setting is restricted by your Server Configuration. For example, if your php Configuration only allows a maximum of 2 MB uploads, this cannot be overwritten by the Mod. Bytes KB MB This Setting defines the Maximum Filesize for one Attachment. This Setting is restricted by your PHP Configuration. If your provider does not allow file uploads or set them to 0 byte, or restricted it to 2 MB for example, the Mod is unable to overwritethis value. If your provider has set the maximum upload size to 2 MB and you define a filesize of 5 MB, you are only able to upload a maximumfilesize of 2 MB. Attachment Quota Maximum Disk Space ALL Attachments can hold on your Webspace. A value of 0 means \'unlimited \'. Bytes KB MB This is your highest Attachment Quota Setting, even the Administrator is not allowed to exceed this Limit. This Setting is to prevent too many uploads; most providers are setting limitations to usable disk space. Maximum Filesize in Private Messages Folder Maximum Disk Space Attachments can use up in each User \'s Private Message box. A value of 0 means \'unlimited \'. Bytes KB MB This setting is a default Quota Limit for every users \' Private Message Box. Users without a quota setting are limitedto this Filesize within their Private Message Box. This setting determines the total space taken by all Attachments within the users \' Private Message Box, not the size of each file. Default Quota Limit Here you are able to select the Default Quota Limit automatically assigned to newly registered Users and Users without an defined Quota Limit. The Option \'No Quota Limit \' is for not using any Attachment Quotas, instead using the default Settings you have defined within this Management Panel. No Quota Limit Low Medium High Upload Quota No Quota Limit Low Medium High PM Quota This Setting defines your Default Quota Limits. The Upload Quota is for limiting the User on Attachments postedin Messages, and the PM Quota on Attachments within users Private Message Box. Since within this example a PM Quota of \'No Quota Limit \'is set, the \'Maximum Filesize in Private Messages Folder \' Setting will be used. If the Upload Quota is set to \'No Quota Limit \' the \'Attachment Quota \' Setting will be used. Please keep in mind, even if you set a UploadQuota Limit higher than the Attachment Quota, this Limit will fall back to the defined Attachment Quota, because this is your highestdefinable Value. Maximum Number of Attachments The maximum number of attachments allowed in one post. This Setting is for defining the maximum Number of Attachments allowed to be uploaded to one Post. Maximum number of Attachments in one Private Message Define the maximum number of attachments the user is allowed to include in a private message. This Setting is for defining the maximum Number of Attachments allowed to be uploaded to one Private Message. Disable Attachment Mod This option is mainly for testing new templates or themes, it disables all Attachment Functions except the Admin Panel. Yes No This Option is for disabling the Attachment Mod. Allow Attachments in Private Messages Allow/Disallow attaching files to Private Messages. Yes No This Option is for allowing or disallowing Users to be able to attach Files to Private Messages. Do you want to display Attachments in the Topic Review Window ? If you choose yes, all attached Files will be displayed in Topic Review when you post a reply. Yes No This Option let you choose whether you want to show previously posted Attachments within the Topic Review Windowwhile Replying to Threads or not. Please keep in mind allowing this Option will add additional Load to your Posting Page. Show new Attachment Posting Control Panel Choose whether to display the Attachment Posting Control Panel (yes) or the old method with two Boxes for Attaching Files and editing your posted Attachments (no) within your Posting Screen. The look of it is very hard to explain, therefore it \'s best to try it out. Yes No This Option will enable or disable the Attachment Posting Control Panel. If set to yes, your Attachment Box will look like this: Attachment Posting Control Panel If you click on Add an Attachment, you will see the box for adding Attachments. If you click on Posted Attachments, you will see a list of already attached Files and you are able to edit them. If you want to Replace (Upload new Version) an Attachment, you have to click both links. Add the Attachment as you normally would do, thereafter don \'t click on Add Attachment, rather click on Upload New Version at the Attachment Entry you intend to update. Options If set to no, your Attachment Box will look like this: Add an Attachment If you do not want to add an Attachment to your Post, please leave the Fields blank Allowed Extensions and Sizes Filename File Comment Posted Attachments Filename acydamp.zip File Comment A very long description Options You are not able to use the FTP Upload Methods, because FTP Extensions are not compiled into your PHP Installation. If you see this Note, you are unable to use the FTP Upload Methods. Enable FTP Upload Enable/Disable the FTP Upload option. If you set it to yes, you have to define the Attachment FTP Settings and the Upload Directory is no longer used. Yes No This Option is for enabling FTP and FTP Remote Upload. FTP Upload Server Here you can enter the IP-Address or FTP-Hostname of the Server used for your uploaded files. If you leave this field empty, the Server on which your phpBB2 Board is installed will be used. Please note that it is not allowed to add ftp:// or something else to the address, just plain ftp.foo.com or, which is a lot faster, the plain IP Address. This is for defining your FTP Upload Server. If you want to define a remote Server for uploading your Files throughFTP, enter the IP Address of this Server. If you want to use the same Server your phpBB2 Board is installed, leave this field empty. The default Port 21 is used for FTP Uploads. FTP Path to your upload directory The Directory where your Attachments will be stored. This Directory doesn \'t have to be chmodded. Please don \'t enter your IP or FTP-Address here, this input field is only for the FTP Path. For example: /home/web/uploads This Setting is for defining the FTP Upload Path, this seems to be the trickiest setting for users, since this pathdoes not depend on your phpBB2 Path. This Setting depends on your FTP Entry Point when connecting to your FTP Server. If you set a relative Path here, please keep thisin mind. Now some examples for better understanding: If you connect to your FTP Server, the lowest path where you are is: public_html Your phpBB2 Board is at: public_html/phpBB2 Your Upload Directory is at: public_html/uploads Your complete home path at this Server is: /home/web/users/v92387 (most users do not know this path, they have to look up their Provider Information to find this one out) A relative Path to your Upload Directory would be: public_html/uploads An absolute Path to your Upload Directory would be: /home/web/users/v92387/public_html/uploads Download Link to FTP Path Enter the URL to your FTP Path, where your Attachments are stored. If you are using a Remote FTP Server, please enter the complete url, for example http://www.mystorage.com/phpBB2/upload. If you are using your Local Host to store your Files, you are able to enter the url path relative to your phpBB2 Directory, for example \'upload \'. A trailing slash will be removed. Leave this field empty, if the FTP Path is not accessible from the Internet. With this field empty you are unable to use the physical download method. This Setting is relevant for downloading Attachments. If you are not using a Remote FTP Server, you are able to enter the path relative to your phpBB2 Directory: phpBB2 URL: http://www.mysite.com/phpBB2 Upload URL: http://www.mysite.com/phpBB2/uploads Download Link to FTP Path: uploads If you are using a Remote FTP Server, you have to enter a complete URL to your Upload Directory: phpBB2 URL: http://www.mysite.com/phpBB2 Upload URL: http://www.storageplace.com/uploads Download Link to FTP Path: http://www.storageplace.com/uploads If you are unable to access your FTP Upload Directory directly from the web, you are able to leave this field blank. But then you are unable to use the physical download method, but this one is used rarely. More about the download methods will beexplained later. Enable FTP Passive Mode The PASV command requests that the remote server open a port for the data connection and return the address of that port. The remote server listens on that port and the client connects to it. Yes No This is for using the FTP Passive Mode to Upload and Download Attachments, some FTP Server are configured the wayto only allow Passive Mode connections. If FTP Uploading does not work for you, try to enable/disable this Mode. Your FTP Username Here you have to enter the Username with which you are connecting to your FTP Server. Your FTP Password Here you have to enter the Password with which you are connecting to your FTP Server. With the Submit button you are submitting your changes. With the Reset button you are re-setting your changes. With the Test Settings Button you are able to test your entered settings. For example, if you have chosen FTP Upload, the Attachment Mod istesting if all settings are correct and if the Mod is able to connect to the server and to upload a file. With Test Settings you receive more accurate Errors on what you have missed or what is not working as in the posting Screen. 5.3 Quota Limits Within this Panel you are able to define the Constants for your Quota Limits, you are able to add new Quota Limits, changeexisting ones and delete them. The following is the default Quota Limit View Manage Attachment Quota Limits Description Filesize Add Bytes KB MB Description Filesize Delete View Bytes KB MB View Bytes KB MB View Bytes KB MB At the Top you are able to add a new Quota Limit. You can assign the listed Quota Limits to Users and Groups later. To assign a Quota Limit to a User, you have to go to Users-&gt;Management,select the User and you will see the Options at the bottom. To assign a Quota Limit to a Group, go to Groups-&gt;Management, select theGroup to edit it, and you will see the Configuration Settings. If you want to see, which Users and Groups are assigned to a specificQuota Limit, click on \'View \' at the left of the Quota Description. Now let \'s have a look at the \'View \' of the \'Medium \' Limit Medium Assigned Users - Upload Quota Smarty Assigned Groups - Upload Quota Group 2 Assigned Users - PM Quota Testuser Assigned Groups - PM Quota This View is only for informing you about the Groups and Users assigned to the Quota Limit. To change this for Users and Groups, you have to go the the Groups Management Screen or the Users Management Screen. More about Quota Limits and how they work is explained in four additional Sections: The Quota System How to set up Default quotas How to set up User and Group quotas How Quota Limit Changes will affect User and Group Quotas 5.4 Shadow Attachments Within the Shadow Attachments Screen you can delete Attachments from Posts or Private Messages. You are also able to delete Files no longer assigned to any Post or Private Message. It is recommended to handle this Screen very carefully, view the Attachments before you delete them (if a link to the Attachment is provided).After you have deleted Attachments, Synchronize them (see next Section). 5.5 Synchronize Attachments With this Link you are able to Synchronize your Attachments. The Attachment Mod goes to all topics and posts verifyingif the Attachment Data is correct, since every topic and every Post with Attachments is marked, this mark has to be deleted if no Attachmentexists. Normally this is dnne automatically, therefore it is advised to run this Sync only if you have problems viewing Attachments. Next, Synchronization will detect if the Thumbnail Data on Attachments is correct, if no Thumbnail exists on Attachment (marked as havinga Thumbnail) this Attachment will be reset and the Thumbnail Data deleted. Here is a typical Output of this Synchronize (I have manually deleted Thumbnails to show you the Reset Information): Sync Topics ....................... Sync Thumbnails ....... Attachment Syncronization Finished. Thumbnail resetted for Attachment: acyd.jpg Thumbnail resetted for Attachment: takeittux.JPG Thumbnail resetted for Attachment: linux_chick1.jpg Thumbnail resetted for Attachment: linux13_177.jpg Thumbnail resetted for Attachment: linux_chick1_145.jpg Thumbnail resetted for Attachment: linux13_131.jpg 6. The Extensions Administration Panels 6.1 Extension Control Within this Panel, you are able to add and delete Extensions. Every Extension is assigned to an Extension Group, whetherthis Group is enabled or not. There is a special Extension Group for pending Extensions, it is called \'Not Assigned \'. If a ExtensionGroup gets deleted, the Extensions assigned to this Group are automatically unassigned, meaning they are pending status.These Extensions are of course not allowed to be attached to your Board. You are able to enter an Explanation for your Extensions, the Explanation is only viewable to you within this Panel and is intended for youto better identify it. The following is an example of this Panel, click a few DropDown-Boxes to see which Extension Groups I have set up on my test board.

To delete Extensions, just click the Checkbox beside an existing Extension. To change the Extension Group of an Extension, just select it with the DropDown Box. After you have made all changes you can click Submit to enter them into the Database. 6.2 Extension Groups Control Ok, this Panel is for defining almost everything handling with Extensions. Since every Extension has to be in one ExtensionGroup, the Extension Groups are the main Configuration Point you can set up. Let us have a look at a Standard Panel for Extension Groups Manage Extension Groups Extension Group Special Category Allowed Download Mode Upload Icon Maximum Filesize Allowed Forums Add none Images Stream Files Flash Files inline physical Bytes KB MB Extension Group Special Category Allowed Download Mode Upload Icon Maximum Filesize Allowed Forums Delete + none Images Stream Files Flash Files inline physical Bytes KB MB Group Permissions + none Images Stream Files Flash Files inline physical Bytes KB MB Group Permissions + none Images Stream Files Flash Files inline physical Bytes KB MB Group Permissions + none Images Stream Files Flash Files inline physical Bytes KB MB Group Permissions + none Images Stream Files Flash Files inline physical Bytes KB MB Group Permissions + none Images Stream Files Flash Files inline physical Bytes KB MB Group Permissions + none Images Stream Files Flash Files inline physical Bytes KB MB Group Permissions + none Images Stream Files Flash Files inline physical Bytes KB MB Group Permissions As you can see, there are a bunch of Options/Settings you are able to change. We are going through all of them step by step. First, I will explain the Options you are able to choose from. Special Category You are able to assign a Special Category to Extension Groups, the same Special Category is allowed to be assigned to more than one Extension Group. At the moment there are four Special Categories: none, Images, Stream Files and Flash Files. You are able to define the Settings taking effect for the Special Category Images within the Special Categories Admin Panel (see Section 6.4 (Special Categories) for details). Extensions (posted Files with the Extension) within Extension Groups assigned to the Special Category \'Stream Files \' are automaticallyplayed within the Post/PM. The supported Types for streaming files highly depends on the User \'s Windows Media Player Plugin. TheseExtensions have been reported to be working: aif, aifc, aiff, asf, asx, au, avi, ivf, m3u, mid, midi, mlv, mp2, mp3, mp2v, mpa, mpe, mpeg, mpg, mpv2, rmi, snd, wav, wax, wm, wma, wmx, wmv and wxv Extensions (posted Files with the Extension) within Extension Groups assigned to the Special Category \'Flash Files \' are automaticallyplayed within the Post/PM. Of course this Special Category is intended for Flash Files. ;) The Setting \'none \' is not a Special Category. If \'none \' is selected the Attachment Mod displays a simple Download Link to the File,this is the normal way the Attachment Mod handles Files. Allowed or not Allowed There is a little Checkbox for letting you allow an Extension Group. Only if Extension Groups are allowed, the Users (and you) are able to attachFiles with the Extension defined within the allowed Extension Group. Download Mode There are two possible Download Methods you are able to use: physical and logical. The physical method: This will point the attachment link to the original File. If you (or a user) click on an Attachment which Extension Group is setto physical download method, the browser will point directly to this file. Of course the download.php file is called to check Permissionsand other things, but the delivery method consist of a simple Location Header (or Refresh if the Server does not Support this Header). The downside of this method is that Users sometimes receive cryptic Filenames (with random Numbers at the end) and your Upload Directoryhas to be accessible from the Internet. Therefore, this method should only be used for Extensions that need the File in complete. I only know of one: Real Media Files. Additionally,try this Download Method if you think your downloaded Files got garbled. The logical method: The Logical Download Method is the standard Method to use. It \'s for pointing the User to the correct Attachment and presenting themthe correct Name for the Attachment, even if it \'s saved differently at your webspace. Even if the Upload Directory is not accessiblefrom the Internet, the File gets downloaded correctly. Upload Icon This Setting is the same as within the Management Screen (Setting Name: \'Attachment Posting Icon \'). You are able to define thoseAttachment Posting Icons individually for every Extension Group. If an Upload Icon is empty, the one from the Management Panel will be used. Maximum Filesize You are able to define the Maximum allowed filesize for Attachments within Extension Groups, this is definable for every Extension Group. If you change the Maximum allowed filesize within the Management Panel and you haven \'t changed the Filesizes for Extension Groups,the Extension Groups are getting updated to reflect this new Filesize. Add an Extension Group Manage Extension Groups Extension Group Special Category Allowed Download Mode Upload Icon Maximum Filesize Allowed Forums Add none Images Stream Files Flash Files inline physical Bytes KB MB To add an Extension Group, you have to enter a Name for the Extension Group and click the Add Checkbox. After youhave clicked on Submit the Extension Group will be added. You are also able to define the additional Settings too, of course. Newly added Extension Groups are empty by default, you have to assign Extensions to Extension Groups with the Extension Control Panel . Viewing Extensions You can have a look at the Extensions assigned to an particular Extension Group by clicking at the plus sign Extension Group Special Category Allowed Download Mode Upload Icon Maximum Filesize Allowed Forums Delete - none Images Stream Files Flash Files inline physical Bytes KB MB Group Permissions gif png jpeg jpg 6.2.1 Extension Groups Forum Permissions If you click the Group Permissions Link, you are able to choose the Forums where the User is able to Post Attachmentswith Extensions defined within the Extension Group. For example, if I click on the Permissions Link for the Extension Group \'My Images \' Allowed Forums ALL FORUMS Add Forums ALL FORUMS Diskussionen Test2 Test1 The following is the Introduction Text for Group Permissions: Here you are able to restrict the selected Extension Group to Forums of your choice (defined in the Allowed Forums Box). The Defaultis to allow Extension Groups to all Forums the User is able to Attach Files into (the normal way the Attachment Mod has since the beginning).Just add those Forums you want the Extension Group (the Extensions within this Group) to be allowed there, the default ALL FORUMS willdisappear when you add Forums to the List. You are able to re-add ALL FORUMS at any given Time. If you add a Forum to your Board andthe Permission is set to ALL FORUMS nothing will change. But if you have changed and restricted the access to certain Forums, youhave to check back here to add your newly created Forum. It is easy to do this automatically, but this will force you to edit a bunchof Files, therefore I have chosen to keep it the way it is now. Keep in mind that all of your Forums will be listed here. 6.3 Forbidden Extensions Within this Panel you are able to define Extensions forbidden to be attached. There are three default Extensions you are not able to delete, because they will open a huge security leak into your Board. Also, the Extensions defined here are unable to be added to the allowed Extensions, and Administrators are not able to attach them too.Within this Panel only the high security risk Extensions should be added, because the Mod is configured to only allow enabled Extensions tobe attached there is no need to define all Extensions you want to not be attached here. 6.4 Special Categories Within this Panel you are able to define Parameters and Settings for Extension Groups within Special Categories.At the moment only the Special Category Images are configurable here. The Header is showing you to which Extension Group/Groups this changes will have effects on Settings for Special Category: Images Assigned Group: My Images The Special Category is called \'Images \' and the assigned Extension Group is \'My Images \'. Now to the settings you are able to make to the Special Category Images: Display Images Inlined Choose whether to display images directly within the post (yes) or to display images as a link ? Yes No If this is set to yes, the posted Extensions within the Extension Group \'My Images \' will be displayed as an image: acyd_ava.gif Description: This is my Avatar Image Filesize: 3.1 KB Viewed: 10 Time(s) -&gt; The Image will be displayed here &lt;- The Inline display can be restricted by the Image Link Dimensions (will be explained here too). Create Thumbnail Always create a Thumbnail. This feature overrides nearly all Settings within this Special Category, except of the Maximum Image Dimensions. With this Feature a Thumbnail will be displayed within the post, the User can click it to open the real Image. Please Note that this feature requires Imagick to be installed, if it \'s not installed or if Safe-Mode is enabled the GD-Extension of PHP will be used. If the Image-Type is not supported by PHP, this Feature will be not used. Yes No This Setting is for enabling the Creation of Thumbnails. The only Setting affecting this Option is the Image Link Dimensions Setting. This Setting could be hidden from you if the Attachment Mod detect that you are unable to create Thumbnails. Please refer to Section 7.6 on how to get Thumbnails working. Minimum Thumbnail Filesize If a Image is smaller than this defined Filesize, no Thumbnail will be created, because it \'s small enough. Bytes Somewhat self-explaining, but I want to add a little note here. If your server-config is broken or the filesize() function is not allowed,the Attachment Mod will identify all Attachments as having a filesize of 0 Bytes, meaning that a Thumbnail will never be created. This Setting could be hidden from you if the Attachment Mod detect that you are unable to create Thumbnails. Imagick Program (Complete Path) Enter the Path to the convert program of imagick, normally /usr/bin/convert (on windows: c:/imagemagick/convert.exe). Make sure the path to imagemagick does not contain Spaces. (for example \'program files \' &lt;- there is a space within the directory name, this will not work) You are able to search for this Program with the Search Imagick Button. Maximum Image Dimensions Here you can define the maximum allowed Image Dimension to be attached (Width x Height in pixels). If it is set to 0x0, this feature is disabled. With some Images this Feature will not work due to limitations in PHP. x This Setting is for defining the Maximum allowed Image Dimensions to be posted. This is to prevent you from screwingup your Board with too high Resolution Images or because you simply do not want to let Images greater than 1024x768 to be posted (for example). Image Link Dimensions If this defined Dimension of an Image is reached, the Image will be displayed as a Link, rather than displaying it inlined, if Inline View is enabled (Width x Height in pixels). If it is set to 0x0, this feature is disabled. With some Images this Feature will not work due to limitations in PHP. x This is for defining the border from Inline View to displaying an Link. If the Dimension you set here is exceeded, the Image is displayed as an Link. This Setting overrides the Inline View (of course) and the Thumbnail Creation. If you want to create Thumbnails of all Images, the best is to set this Dimension to 0x0. With the Search Imagick Button you are able to Search for the ImageMagick program. With the Test Settings you are able to test the Thumbnail Settings, it is highly recommended to do this, because this procedure createsa directory under your Upload Directory with the name \'thumbs \' for placing the Thumbnails into it. If this Directory does not exist, the Attachment Mod is unable to create Thumbnails. 7. General Administrative Settings and Features (HowTo \'s) 7.1 How to set up Permissions for Attaching and Downloading Yes, you are able to set Permissions on downloading and attaching files. The Permissions are the same as the ones you know for Reading, Voting, Create Polls... If you set Permissions for Downloading and Attaching, please be sure to use the Advanced Mode. A little Example: You want to create a Usergroup allowed to attach files, you want downloading to be restricted to Registered Users only. These Permissions are for your Forum called \'Downloads \' (only an example). The Usergroup: Create a new Usergroup, name it for Example: attach users Open up the Forum Permissions Control Panel, select your Forum (here: Downloads) and go to the Advanced Mode. Set the Permission to attach Files to PRIVATE (to be able to assign it to the Usergroup) and the Permission to Download Files to REG. Now go to the Usergroups Permissions Panel and change the Permission for the Group \'attach users \' to YES at the \'Downloads \'-Forum. As you can see, the two Permissions (Attaching and Downloading) acting like the other Permissions you are able to set/configure. 7.2 The Quota System The Quota System is defined as limiting Users/Groups to a defined maximum Storage Limit. This Limit is not set on a per file basis, it is a general setting, counting the Filesize of all attached Files by the User/Group. Quota Limits are definable for Uploaded Files within Posts and for uploaded Files within Private Messages. Attachments included intoPrivate Messages in your SENT Box are not counted. There is one Setting (within the Management Screen) for defining a maximum Attachment Quota, this defined Filesize is the largestStorage Limit you are able to set, no Quota Limit is able to exceed this defined Limit, even the Administrator is not allowed to exceedthis Limit. The Group Quota is defined as a Quota Limit to each User of the Group, not the Group in whole. If there are multiple quotas set for one user, only one quota will be used by AttachMod: Group Quotas have the highest Priority, if more than one Group exists for the User, the Group with the largest (in Size) Quota will begiven the highest Priority. User Quotas have the lowest priority. Example: User A has a quota of 30 megabytes assigned to him/her. User A is in Group Alpha and Group Beta. Group Alpha has a quota of 20 megabytes and Group Beta has no quota. User A will be given a quota of 20 megabytes; not 30 megabytes because Group Alpha has the largest quota of the two groups and takes priorityover user quotas. Remember, no quota may be larger than the Attachment Quota setup in the Management Screen. (See Section 5.2 ) 7.3 How to set up Default quotas Default Quotas will be assigned to newly registered Users and Users with no Quota Setting. You are able to define Default Quotas within the Attachments Management Screen. A value of \'No Quota Limit \' disables the Assignment of Quotasto newly registered Users, they will have no Quota Limit. If no Quota Limit is assigned, the System Parameters are used, this means every User is able to attach Files until the complete AttachmentQuota is reached. 7.4 How to set up User and Group quotas User Quotas will be assigned to Users. You are able to directly assign a Quota Limit to a User by using the Users Management Administration Panel. After you have chosen the User you want to edit, have a look at the \'Special admin-only fields \'. You should see two new dropdown boxes: Upload Quota and PM Quota. You are able to define the Quota Limit for any specific User now. Group Quotas will be assigned to Groups. You are able to assign a Quota Limit to an existing Group. If you want to create a new Group, you will not see the Quota Settings, youhave to create the Group, then you have to edit the Group in order to set the Quota Limits in the same way as the User Quota Limits. 7.5 How Quota Limit Changes will affect User and Group Quotas If you want to change the Filesize Limit for your Medium Storage Limit from 1 MB to 2 MB, you probably won \'t want togo through each user and group and set each quote individually. This method was implemented for that very reason. With the Attachment Mod you are able to define Quota Constants, setting a descriptive word for your Limit. For example: Medium -&gt; 1 MB Now you assign this constant (Medium) to two Groups and ten Users. After a week you notice that the Quota is too low and you want to change it to 2 MB. Now you only have to change the constant from 1 MB to 2 MB, the change will be directly assigned to your two Groups and ten Users. If a Quota Constant is deleted, all Users/Groups with this defined Setting are automatically switched back to the Default/No Quota Setting. You are able to see which Users/Groups are assigned to which Quota Setting too. Please have a look at Section 5.3 (Quota Limits) in order to see how your are able to set/change/delete Quota Settings and how to viewthe current Quota Assignments. 7.6 How to get Thumbnails working The ability to create Thumbnails are only given to the Special Category \'Images \'. Therefore you have to assign this Category to an Extension Group first. After you have assigned the Special Category \'Images \' to one (or more) Extension Groups within the Administration Panel -&gt; Extension GroupsManagement Screen you have to go to Administration Panel -&gt; Special Categories. Enable the Option to Create Thumbnails. Additionally, set the Image Link Dimensions to 0x0 if you don \'t want to present Links to yourImage if they are greater than the defined size you have entered there. The last Step is to Test the Thumbnail Settings. The Test Process will create the necessary Directory too. You should also search for the ImageMagick program if you are unable to recall the correct path to the program. Please make sure the path to imagemagick does not contain Spaces. (for example \'program files \' &lt;- there is a space within the directoryname, this will not work) If you do not see the Options for Thumbnails the Attachment Mod detected that you are not able to create Thumbnails, therefore it was disabled. 8. How to use the Attachment Mod 8.1 Posting and Editing Attachments - Posts and Private Messages In general you are able to post, edit and delete Attachments within Posts and Private Messages. I will explain the procedure for Posts, since for Private Messages it is the same. To open your board and post a message while reading this section will help you to understand what is explained here. To see something whilereading, the explanation usually becomes more helpful. While writing a new post, you will see the Attachment Posting Control Panel, either you will see two buttons to open the Add AttachmentsBox and the Posted Attachments Box or you will see both boxes at the beginning, this depends on how the Administrator (you) has set theview within the Attachment Management Screen. Within the Add Attachment Box you will see a little link to the Attachment Rules, there you are able to see a little overview of what you areable to attach and which filesize restrictions are set. Within the Add Attachment Box you are able to enter a comment for your Attachmentand you are able to add a file itself by clicking the Browse Button. After you have chosen a file you want to attach (comment field is allowed to be left blank) you are able to click the Add AttachmentButton to add the file. If you directly click submit the file will still be added with the Post. Within the Posted Attachment Box you are able to edit your file comments or delete Attachments. After you have changed an existing comment, you have to click the Update Comment button. You are able to delete Attachments by clicking the Delete Attachment Button on the Attachment Entry you want to delete. The Administratoris able to delete Thumbnails from Posts. After deleting a Thumbnail the normal Image is displayed. You are able to replace a file too (practical for uploading new versions of files). Select the file you want to upload (without clicking theAdd Attachment button) and click the Upload New Version Button. 8.2 Additional Viewable Areas 8.2.1 User Profiles The user itself is able to view his Upload Status and Quota Setting within his Profile. The Administrator is able to view it too. Here is an example of this Status Field 0% 50% 100% [Uploaded: 550.58 KB / Quota: 2 MB / 27% of total] User Attachment Control Panel As you can see, the user is able to see his current uploaded filesize and the complete Filesize he is able to Upload. The Link to the User Attachment Control Panel will open the User Attachment Control Panel. 8.2.2 User Attachment Control Panel Within this Panel, the user is able to see all of his uploaded Files and is able to delete them. It will look like this: User Attachment Control Panel :: testuser Forum Index Select sort method: Filename Comment Extension Size Downloads Post Time Order Ascending Descending # Filename File Comment Extension Size (KB) Downloads Post Time Posted in Topic Delete 1 linux13.jpg jpg 108.27 1 Sun Nov 17, 2002 8:56 pm fsgjiosd 2 linux13.jpg jpg 108.27 1 Sun Nov 17, 2002 9:01 pm zrezerw 3 linux13.jpg jpg 108.27 1 Sun Nov 17, 2002 9:02 pm Private Message 4 linux_chick1.jpg jpg 53.29 1 Sun Nov 17, 2002 8:59 pm sdgsdag 5 linux_chick1.jpg jpg 53.29 1 Sun Nov 17, 2002 9:01 pm zrezerw 6 linux10.jpg jpg 48.04 2 Sun Nov 17, 2002 8:56 pm fsgjiosd 7 acyd.jpg jpg 43.52 0 Sun Nov 17, 2002 8:59 pm sdgsdag 8 takeittux.jpg jpg 21.46 0 Sun Nov 17, 2002 8:59 pm sdgsdag 9 acyd_ava.gif gif 3.1 14 Sun Nov 17, 2002 8:55 pm fsgjiosd 10 acyd_ava.gif gif 3.1 10 Sun Nov 17, 2002 9:01 pm zrezerw Mark all :: Unmark all As you can see, the user is able to do nearly the same as the Administrator is able to do within the Attachment Control Panel. The Administrator is able to view the Control Panel for Anonymous/Guest Users too. You are able to do so by calling the User Attachment Control Panel directly with the Anonymous User ID http://www.yourdomain.com/phpBB2/uacp.php?u=-1 9. Common Problems attaching Files 9.1 Filesize too big / Post Mode not specified / Blank Page If you get Error Messages saying the Filesize is too big after submitting your post, even if you are attaching Files below 1 Kbyte. The most common reason for this error is that your provider has enabled File Uploading on the Server, but he probably have set the Maximum Filesize to 0 Byte. Another reason could be that you are trying to attach a File bigger than the maximum allowed upload size defined by your Provider. The Attachment Mod is unable to overwrite this value. If you are trying to attach very big files the execution time limit may have been exceeded. Here is a list of all PHP Variables interfering directly or indirectly with File Uploading: max_execution_time memory_limit post_max_size file_uploads upload_max_filesize Please refer to the PHP Documentation on how to configure this variables. If you get the Error Message \'no Post Mode specified \' after submitting your Post or a blank page. The most common reason for this error is that your provider does not allow File Uploads at all. Ask your provider or create a php-file with this content: &lt;? phpinfo(); ?&gt; Upload the File to your webspace, execute it and look for the variable \'file uploads \', it have to be set to 1, if not, file uploading is not allowed. Additional Informations for both problems: new twist on No post mode... problem -Thread posted at Opentools.de. 9.2 Could not attach File, but Post has been stored / Filesize is 0 all over the time If you get the Error Message \'Could not Attach File. Post has been stored \' after submitting your Post. Either your Provider does not allow the function filesize(), which is very bad, because nothing can be done to solve the problem, or your TemporaryPHP Directory is not setup properly. (Only for people hosting their own Website) Every Attachment uploaded to the board will go into the PHP Temporary Upload Directory. Please check the Permissions of this Directory and make sure PHP is allowed to write to it. For users using Apache/IIS on Windows, you might want to check the following Settings: (Thanks to SFGrimoire :: complete thread about this error ) The IUSR_hostname account needs to have read/write access to the system temp directory, otherwise you will receive the following access failure: Event Type:	Failure Audit Event Source:	Security Event Category:	Object Access Event ID:	560 Date:	9/16/2002 Time:	12:05:52 PM User:	W2KNCHTNPC \\IUSR_W2KNCHTNPC Computer:	W2KNCHTNPC Description: Object Open: Object Server:	Security Object Type:	File Object Name:	C: \\WINNT \\Temp New Handle ID:	- Operation ID:	{0,450981} Process ID:	812 Primary User Name:	W2KNCHTNPC Primary Domain:	AFS Primary Logon ID:	(0x0,0x3E7) Client User Name:	IUSR_W2KNCHTNPC Client Domain:	W2KNCHTNPC Client Logon ID:	(0x0,0x61349) Accesses	SYNCHRONIZE ReadData (or ListDirectory) Privileges	- The specific permissions required are: hostname \\IUSR_hostname:(OI)(CI)(special access:) DELETE READ_CONTROL SYNCHRONIZE FILE_READ_DATA FILE_WRITE_DATA FILE_APPEND_DATA FILE_EXECUTE Also, if you change the upload directory in php.ini the IUSR_hostname account needs the same permissions. 9.3 General Error: Could not Attach File This Error is a default Message if something is not setup. To test the various things and give you an appropriate Error Message is too time intensive for a post page, therefore it was placed into the Administration Panel. Go to Adminstration Panel -&gt; Management and click on \'Test Settings \', now you should receive a more detailed Error Message, explaining what you have to do in order for the Attachment Mod to work correctly. In most cases you have forgotten to chmod the upload directory. 9.4 I am able to attach files in Private Messages, but with normal Posts i cannot Attach files You may have made a mistake while editing your includes/auth.php file, please re-check this file. The line to be added has to be placed AFTER the closing brace, and not Before it. If this was not the error, please check if you have edited and uploaded your posting_body.tpl file. 9.5 No Attachments are displayed Since the Attachment Mod Version 2.3.5 a check was integrated to bypass the different viewtopic.php versions users are magically using. But please check if you have added the last line between ); and } within the viewtopic.php file. The correct result for the last line to be added to the viewtopic.php file should look like this: \'U_POST_ID \' =&gt; postrow&#91;i&#93;&#91; \'post_id \'&#93;&#41; &#41;; display_post_attachments&#40;postrow&#91;i&#93;&#91; \'post_id \'&#93;, postrow&#91;i&#93;&#91; \'post_attachment \'&#93;&#41;; 10.

This digest feature depends on having a batch scheduling system that you can use. You will need to figure out a way to program your batch scheduling system to call the mail_digests.php program once an hour every hour of the day, every day of the week. If you cannot do that then there is no point using this feature! How easy it is to do this step depends on whether you own your web server or it is hosted externally for you and how easily you can access the web server. If you own the server then presumably you are already familiar with the server operating system and the commands needed. If you contract with a web host, access it remotely and you have never ventured beyond FTP to transmit files then you will have to connect via a terminal mode to issue the operating system commands to interact with your batch scheduling system. If you do not have access to your server, or cannot setup some kind of local scheduling, see the method at the bottom of this page. If your server is brought down you may have to go in manually and reprogram the crontab, so make a note of what you did, or store the commands in a file. Usage notes Most users who receive HTML digests using web based email programs like Yahoo! Mail will likely not see cascading style sheets applied to the HTML email unless frames are enabled, with a frame for the content of the email message. In the case of Yahoo! Mail, the message is displayed inside of a table &lt;td&gt; tag. Yahoo! Mail strips out &lt;link&gt; and related tags and appears to shove whatever content is between the &lt;body&gt; and the &lt;/body&gt; tags of the email into the cell where the message appears. It all still works, just may not look as fancy (but still better than text). You can use any theme you have installed on your board to theme the digest. By default it will use whatever theme the user has set (unless you have an overriding theme set in the ACP). If you want to overide both the board default and the user default (say you always want it to use subSilver, and your boards default is someething else) then you can set OVERIDE_THEME to true, and then set DIGEST_THEME to the theme (from the database) of the theme you want to use. Any images will be striped out of the theme, but colors sill stick and if the theme is well put together the colors will be at least close to the images that should be covering them. Note that the digest pulls the theme data from the database, NOT a css file. Test to see if the digest user interface is working correctly. Via URL invoke digests.php in your phpBB root folder. Set it up so you receive a digest every hour. Next, test to see if you can receive an email digest. Via ACP, run the Mail Digests. You should see a text output indicating who received a digest, how many messages were sent and other information, that may or may not be usefull, along with a total count of the digests sent and some server date and time information. This will help in testing and resolving potential issues. Since this program is normally run automatically this information is not seen seen, but you can redirect output to a file if you wish (depending on how your server is configured). It may be an idea to turn logging on at this stage so that you have a record of what has been happening. If the digest was successfully sent it should appear in your email. Next, follow the instructions below to setup batch scheduling and test it. Schedule yourself to receive a digest every hour. Hopefully it will pop into your mailbox in an hour of setting up your digest. If you get errors when you run mail_digests.php you may need to change line 40 to show the absolute path to phpBB on your server (e.g. \'/subfolder/local/home/mysite/mysite.com/ \') It is dependant on how the server is configured. On some servers it will work with the relative path set but on others it needs the absolute path (not sure why!) Instructions for setting up a crontab (for Linux/Unix systems) If your web host allows straight telnet access, great. Log in. Skip to step 3. Most web hosts require that if you want a telnet access you have to use a secure telnet program, such as Secure Shell (SSH). Find out from your web host what you need to do to use SSH. My web host (successfulhosting.com) made me go through the following procedures: I had to provide identification by faxing them my driver \'s license. They then configured something on the server side giving me SSH permissions. I then had to download and configure SSH client software (I used Putty, which is free and available at www.chiark.greenend.org.uk ). Using my SSH client I created an encryption key. I then used my host \'s Control Panel to provide the key to my web host. After some wailing and gnashing of teeth I got the thing to work. Eventually I connected successfully, entered my ID and password and got a server operating system prompt. From there I could issue operating system commands.	This was not a trivial process. Elapsed time may take a day or two if you have not done it before. You will need a passing ability to use the Unix vi text editor to program your crontab job. Here is how I did it (do not send the quotes as part of the commands). Note that you need to first figure out the path to the PHP interpreter. I found it in /usr/local/bin but it may be somewhere else. You may have to ask your host \'s technical support department for the information. You also need the absolute path to the location where the mail_digests.php program is stored. From the command prompt, I entered the command crontab -e then Enter, which took me into a vi environment Typing i put me in the vi insert mode Very carefully I typed the following: 00 * * * * wget --delete-after http://yoursomain.com/phpBB2/mail_digests.php --http-user=??? --http-passwd=??? I pressed the Escape key to get out of vi insert mode Typed :wq then Enter to get out of vi. To verify the job was scheduled I entered the command crontab -l then Enter. Logged out. Note: If you want to set up an Urgent digest then follow the instructions above to add another crontab job but at point c. enter the following: */2 * * * * wget --delete-after http://yourdomain.com/phpBB2/mail_digests.php urgent --http-user=??? --http-passwd=??? This will have the effect of running this crontab job every two minutes (change the value 2 to whatever you consider appropriate). Where the \'??? \' parts at the end of the line you typed into vi are the username and password for the protected folder. If you want to do this without any protection, simply remove the last two paramaters completely. For this feature to work a crontab must be programmed to run mail_digests.php once an hour for every hour of the day for every day of the week. The way I programmed this crontab, it will start every hour on the hour (the 00 above is the minute). Guidance on setting up scheduled tasks for Windows 2000 and XP Servers I don \'t have a Windows server, but it looks like if you download the phpAdsNew software at www.phpadsnew.com and read the Administrator \'s manual, pages 24-27 you should be able to figure it out. You will need to download wget for Windows, free software provided by GNU ( www.gnu.org ), and create a batch file, and learn about how to tweak the Windows Task Manager. One user said that after wget was installed they created a batch file that looked like this:	wget -q -O - http://yourdomain.com/phpBB2/mail_digests.php?mode=direct&pass=????	exit In the above where pass=???? replace the ???? with the password entered in Digests Configuration. Quick & easy solution for those who do not have cron enabled I am sure there are many out there who really wish to have a email digest working but the only barrier to overcome is the CRON nonsense. To save yourself all the trouble of setting up cron, simply follow what I have done. We all know by now that the trigger for sending out the digests is mail_digests.php , so as long as we can access this script at a fixed interval, the digest will work. One of the ways to do the above would be to set up cron or pseudocron or anything along that line. Heck, you could even reload that script manually every hour if you wanted to. But why not get others to do it for you? Sign up for any web-based uptime/site monitoring service and make them poll http://yourdomain.com/phpBB2/mail_digests.php EVERY HOUR (the fixed setting for this feature) to check for uptime. Upon trigger, your webhost will send out the digests. VOILA! Ok, I know there are security concerns over this but well, it works so those who are not that particular, go ahead and do so. For a list of free/paid uptime monitors, try www.vivante.com This method has been tested and proven to work, and in fact, it doubles up as a site monitor for you. Cool Stuff! I just cant get item images to appear! This can be caused by a few things. First, the shop only allows .gif and .jpg images at the moment, all images must be placed in the images/shop/ directory. Next, make sure if they \'re not showing in profiles or on threads, that you have the options set to images and not links from Admin - Points System - Shop: Configuration. Lastly, one of the more common mistakes, make sure the images are named EXACTLY the same as the item (this is case sensitive). For example, apple must have an apple.jpg image (or .gif). Apple will not work with apple.gif. How do you add an item? From Admin - Points System - Shop: Configuration update the Shop you wish to add the Item to. Does removing a shop delete all the items from the users who own them? Yes, if your forum is rather large, it \'s probably not a good idea to do this while it \'s busy as it does take quite a few large loops to complete. What does Restocking do? This setting increases the Item stock until it reaches the maximum amount, every amount of time specified by an Admin. What does Multiple Item Buying do? This setting allows your users to buy more than one of each Item. What does Viewtopic Type do? This is a setting to allow you to disable images while viewing topics. It \'s mainly there so users with huge amounts of items don \'t flood your forum \'s screens. \'Link \' just leaves the link to their Inventory, \'Images \' leaves the link and images. What does Selling Rate do? This setting changes the amount users are given back when returning/selling an Item. This is in percent. 100% is a full refund. How do I make the Effects Shop work? From Admin - Points System - Shop: Configuration, click on the Edit button next to Special Shop and enable it. What is the Access Forum field for? It allows you to set up private forums that can only be accessed when a user owns a certain item. Make sure view/post/read/edit are all set to PRIVATE if you want to make use of this feature. --",12),array(14,"operate_faq.html","2005-11-25","FULLY MODDED PHPBB 2 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION","","","Frequently Asked Questions This is a very basic Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page which attempts to answer some of the more commonly asked questions. I am having problems with the admin at a certain board, help! A board has ripped off my graphics/software/etc., stop them! A board is dealing in warez/porn/etc., you need to prevent them doing this! We provide the software, we have absolutely nothing to do with any board that runs it. The GPL grants the user an unlimited right of use subject to their adherence of that licence. Therefore we cannot prevent, dictate, control or otherwise limit the use of this software. So please do not contact us for such matters. If you have a problem with a given board please take it up with them, not us. We are not and cannot be held legally responsible for any third party use of this software (much like Microsoft et al cannot be held responsible for the use of Windows in illegal activities, etc.). Additionally we do not track the use of Fully Modded phpBB software in any way. So please do not ask us for details on a given board we will not be able to help you. If any law firms or lawyers out there send us writs, Cease and Desist orders, etc. for third party website use of this software we reserve the right to charge for time wasted dealing with such issues ... According to viewonline a user is doing/reading something they should not be able to! No, they probably are not. phpBB uses sessions to keep track of users as they move between pages. The session information tells us who this user is. Therefore in order to determine what a user can do on a page we first need the session details. Once this data is available we can check whether the user is permitted to do whatever it is they are trying to do. This can result in it appearing as if a user is reading a topic in a forum they should not be able to access. Or perhaps viewing private messages when they are only guests, etc. In practice the user is not doing these things, they are viewing a You are not permitted to do this type message. The session data has simply been updated before we were able to determine what the user could or could not do. Of course this only applies where permissions have been set correctly! I keep getting Mail sending errors when I (or my users) post/send PM \'s/etc.! This error will occur if phpBB cannot send mail. phpBB can send email two ways; using the PHP mail() function or directly via SMTP. Some hosting providers limit the mail() function to prevent its use in spamming, others may rename it or limit its functionality. In either case you may need to make use of SMTP. This requires that you have access to such a facility, e.g. your hosting provider may provide one (perhaps requiring specific written authorisation), etc. Note that if your provider requires authorisation we only support the simple AUTH method using plaintext username/password. We do not support secure sockets layer (SSL), POP3 send or any other method. Please see www.phpbb.com for additional help on this matter. If you do require SMTP services please do not ask (on our forums or elsewhere) for someone to provide you with one. Open relays are now things of the past thanks to the unthinking spammers out there. Therefore you are unlikely to find someone willing to offer you (free) services. The first four letters of my text disappeared when I hit submit! Some forms in phpBB make use of arrays to post or submit data, e.g. polls, forum management, etc. A bug exists in PHP 4.2.3 (and perhaps older versions) which can cause such data to lose the first four characters of text. This bug is related to the presence of the mbstring module and certain compile time parameters (the problem exists for both compiled in and modular version of mbstring). Please see: bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=19460 for more details. Note the bug is fixed in PHP CVS and thus future versions should be immune. Remember, this is not a bug in phpBB 2. My AOL based users keep getting logged out! phpBB2 uses sessions to keep track of users as they browse the board. These sessions use a combination of a unique session id and the users IP to identify each user. We make use of the IP as an extra safe-guard to help prevent sessions being hijacked (by discovering the unique session id). Unfortunately this only works when the users IP is constant as they browse the board. For most users this will be the case. However certain providers route their users via a cluster of proxys. In some cases, particularly AOL this results in different IPs being forwarded as the user moves between pages. We take account of this by not checking the entire IP but only the first three quads. Again in most cases this will be fine. However again AOL uses IPs which can vary so much that checking only the first two quads results in a fairly static IP being available for session validation. If you are experiencing problems related to this you can make a small change to the code. Please note that reducing the IP validation length does potentially increase the risk of sessions being hijacked (this is something for you to consider, phpBB Group takes no responsibility should anything happen!). The change requires you to open the file includes/sessions.php , find line 385, it contains the following: ip_check_s = substr(userdata[ \'session_ip \'], 0, 6); change this to: ip_check_s = substr(userdata[ \'session_ip \'], 0, 4 ); You need to make exactly the same change to the number 6 in the next line. Save the file (and upload it if required). This should reduce or eliminate the problem noted. I selected X for my timezone but the time is not correct! I suspect the time is correct but that you may have switched (locally) to daylight savings time. At present we do not support daylight savings only standard local times. Therefore during summer months (depending on whether your nation/state switches to daylight savings) the board times may appear to be one hour behind the real local time. The solution is to either put up with it (just let your users know) or to move the timezone of everyone who is affected (remember that not all your users may be from nations who have switched to daylight savings) on one hour, eg. GMT becomes GMT+1. This requires running some SQL and you should search our forums for information. If this is not the case then I suspect your servers time is at fault. phpBB 2 stores all times in the form of a unix timestamp. This is a 32bit integer value containing the number of seconds since the unix epoch event, 1st January 1970 00:00:00 GMT. This value is global in nature and will be the same wherever you are in the world. So, if your time is incorrect and you have selected the appropriate timezone chances are your server time is off. I am seeing &amp;#nnnn; sequences output instead of what I typed! To enable compliance with HTML and XHTML specifications as well as enabling browsers to automatically support a users selected language we enable a charset tag to be output to the browser. This identifies the primary character set the user has selected, eg. iso-8859-1 for Western European languages (English, German, French, etc.), windows-1251 for Cyrillic alphabets (Russian, Bulgarian, etc.) and so on. The downside to doing this is that most modern browsers (such as Internet Explorer) convert any character not present in that character set into what are termed Numerical Character References or NCR \'s. These take the form of &amp;#nnnn; where nnnn is the hexadecimal number of that characters UNICODE reference. Unfortunately PHP (which effectively supports only iso-8859-1 at this time) does not appear to attempt to process this data back into normal characters. Therefore phpBB treats them as text the user has entered and wishes to see . phpBB enables this by turning the &amp; into &amp;amp;. This results in the characters appearing as they do. Although we could ignore &amp;#nnnn; (there are pro \'s and of course con \'s to doing so) at present we don \'t. If you are finding this to be problem the solution is to remove the charset={S_CONTENT_ENCODING} text from all the _header.tpl template files in all templates. The downside to this is a users browser will not automatically switch its charset to that selected by the user (however this is unlikely to be a big problem since users typically run their browser by default in the language they wish to use). Alternatively you can modify the lang[ \'ENCODING \'] entry in the appropriate language file. Until PHP (and all browsers!) trully support UNICODE these problems will persist across all boards. I cannot search for certain words! phpBB 2 uses a Fulltext search system, this has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that on large or busy forums it has far less impact on server load than standard search methods as used by many alternative forums (including phpBB 1.x). The disadvantage is that to reduce the size of the database (every post is examined and unique words stored in a table) we have to limit the size and type of words we store. By default words must contain at least three characters but no more than 25, they must be either alpha or combinations of alpha and numerals (numbers alone are not stored). In addition all non-alphanumeric characters are removed, eg. _, +, -, etc. This is standard practice for fulltext search solutions. A further downside is that non-latin alphabets, eg. Cyrillic, Greek, etc. require proper locale support to be compiled in and available on the server your board is running on. If this is not the case it is quite likely that words will not be properly indexed for storage. In many cases this can be recified by altering the setlocale(LC_ALL, \'[LOCALE_HERE] \'); statement in the appropriate language file. If you are experiencing problems you should change whatever is currently in place of [LOCALE_HERE] with the locale as available on your server. If you do not know this please ask your hosting provider. Some examples may be ru_RU.WIN_CP_1251 for the codepage used for the Russian translation, ko.KOI8 for Korean, etc. Please note that support for multibyte character sets remains very limited in PHP4 and therefore Japanese, Chinese, etc. may have difficulty getting the fulltext search working correctly at all. My screen is filled with errors when I try to view the forum! Are they errors? Are you sure they are not warnings? They probably are ... What you \'re seeing is PHP warn you about unset variables. Great care has been taken with phpBB 2.0 to ensure it is secure. Unset variables while being a potential security risk really shouldn \'t be in 2.0. Unfortunately some hosting providers have decided that any unset variables equal security problems and force PHP to output these warnings even though phpBB 2.0 is set to ignore them. We have worked some way toward checking and/or setting all variables before use but this will take time to complete (if it can be). Therefore I am afraid for the time being you will have to manually modify the code or ask your hosting provider to be more realistic with their setup. How do I use the avatar settings? There are three types of avatar; upload, remote and local. Upload types require you to create a directory (the default is uploads/user_avatars ) and to set this to public read/write (ie. chmod a+rw), users can then upload avatars (subject to width, height and size limits definable by you). Remote avatars allow the user to supply a URI pointing to an image available on the internet, PLEASE NOTE that size limits do not apply to remote avatars! Local avatars allow you to upload your own avatars to a set directory, users can then pick from this avatar gallery. The default location for this is images/avatars . PLEASE NOTE that avatars are categorised according to sub-folders in this location! ie. you MUST place your avatars in subdirectories, eg. images/avatars/cartoons , images/avatars/real-life , etc. No matter what I set the uploadable avatars to I cannot upload one from my computer! There are two possibilities here, the first is you have not created the directory you specified as the storage location for avatars, ie. as specified from Admin - Avatars - Configuration section. If the directory does not exist uploadable avatars are automatically disabled. You should create the required directory (ensuring it has global write access or other appropriate permissions to allow the webserver to write files to it). The second possibility is that your provider has disabled file_upload support, possibly because of a recently found serious security issue with PHP before version 4.1.2. You should contact your provider and ask them if this is the case. It may be unrelated to the security issue and your provider has simply decided to disable such things in general. In either case I \'m afraid there is not a lot you can do, there are still three other avatar settings left to choose from including uploading via a URL which will work fine. I just cannot get gallery avatars to appear! Chances are you have not followed our instructions above. phpBB 2 categorises gallery avatars and it does this by reading through folders contained in the location you specified as being the gallery path. For example, if you set the gallery path to images/avatars phpBB 2 will expect to find a series of folders within that path, eg. images/avatars/moviestars , images/avatars/cartoons , images/avatars/misc , etc. Placing images directly in images/avatars/ will result in nothing being listed in your gallery. I (or my users) cannot stay logged in to the forum! If you (or your users) are, after attempting a login, being returned to the index (or other page) without appearing to be logged in the most likely problem is incorrect cookie settings. phpBB 2 uses cookies to store a session id and a small amount of user data. For this data to be stored correctly the cookie domain, path and secure settings must be correct. You can check this from Admin - General - Configuration - Cookie Settings section. Typically the cookie domain can be left blank and the cookie path set to / (a single forward slash). Do not set the cookie as being secure unless your board is running over a secure sockets layer connection, ie. https:// If you still have problems try setting the cookie domain to your full domain name, eg. www.mysystem.tld, www.something.mydomain.tld. You must ensure the domain name contains at least two dots or browsers will be unlikely to recognise the cookie, eg. .mydomain.com, mydomain.com. Do not add http:// or anything else to the domain name! My users are complaining about being logged out too quickly! You can increase the default length of sessions (ie. how long before a users session is considered \'dead \') from Admin - General - Configuration - Cookie Settings - Session Length. Set it to whatever value your users feel comfortable with, remember that security issues may affect your decision (ie. having too long a session may allow non-users to abuse your board should a user forget to logout or otherwise leave a current session on a public workstation). I am having problems with HTML! If you want to allow your users to make use of HTML in posts you need to do two things. Firstly enable HTML from Admin - Forums - Configuration. Secondly to need to make sure that the tags your users will post are in the Allowed HTML Tags field (again Admin - Forums - Configuration). If users post using tags not on this list they won \'t be displayed as HTML! eg. to enable someone to post Flash you could add the embed tag to this field. Be careful which tags you allow, it is very easy to break the boards own output if the wrong tags are used in posts. My date format is all weird, it shows &lt;37eSaturdayec31 8pm08e= For some unknown reason you may see the date format like this, to fix it you must edit the default_dateformat field in the phpbb_config table of your database from Admin - Database Utilities - phpMyAdmin, simply add a correct php date format. Could not insert new event into calendar table! To enable calendar events to be posted you must edit a forum from Admin - Forums - Management, and set \'Allow Calendar Events \' to Yes to allow events, submit, and then return to that same page. Now scroll to the bottom and you will see a section for adding event types, you must have at least one (1) event type for the calendar to work correctly. Enter an event type and a color, e.g. 006600 or green, and click \'Add Event Type \'. Once you are returned to the forum edit page, you must re-submit for the changes to take effect. What \'s the use of the Journal forum? It \'s a forum where each user has their own thread and only they post messages in that thread. The main difference between a journal forum and a normal forum is that it \'s not for discussion -- you can \'t comment on someone else \'s post. On that basis it has many uses. You can use it for members to write like a blog of what \'s going on. Attach photos and write text so its like a narrated photo album. Give journal permission only to a particular person and it could be a chronology of what \'s happening with the site if your changing it -- or maybe the status of a particular project. There \'s probably heaps more uses. The setting for this can be found from Admin - Forums - Configuration - Journal Forum. My custom Emoticons won \'t work! For these to work properly your server must have the required version of the GD Support library and FreeType installed as stated in the system requirements . Warning: Failed opening \'./modules/language/lang_english/lang_modules.php \' for inclusion on Statistics page! Warning: main(./modules/language/lang_english/lang_modules.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory on Statistics page! Have you actually installed the statistics modules and activated them? You must install and activate at least one (1) pak file from Admin - Statistics - Install Module to use the statistics feature. Warning: mysql_free_result(): 47 is not a valid MySQL result resource! Blank white Usergroups page! This is caused by an incorrect setting in your config.php file, open it with a text editor and change mysql4 to mysql . How do I set forum permissions? You set forum permissions from Admin - Forums - Permissions. This system has two modes of operation; Simple and Advanced. Simple uses a set of pre-defined authorisation levels, these set each type of authorisation setting to a specific level. Advanced settings allow you to specify individual levels for each operation in each forum. Experiment! How do I set user and group permissions? These are set from Admin - Usergroups - Permissions. The system may appear strange but it \'s very powerful. When you look up a user or group it will give you basic information (at the top of the page) followed by the available forum listing and current settings for this user. You can assign moderator status to users and groups and if you have PRIVATE forums (or forums with any of their individual operations set to PRIVATE) you can also assign access. How do I set a user (group) as moderator? See above. Why are there no entries in the user (group) permission Allow Access column? You can only allow (or deny) users access to PRIVATE forums, or forums which have one or more operations set to PRIVATE. How come I cannot set Vote to ALL? phpBB does not by default allow guest voting. This was done to prevent guest users (who cannot be reliably tracked) from voting time and time again in the same poll. How do I turn the Bank on? The bank can be enabled from Admin - Points System - Bank: Configuration, you can also edit the interest rate, the withdraw rate and the interest payment time in seconds. How do I set the special page transitions? These are set from the dropdown selection from Admin - General - Configuration - Board Settings - Page Transition. These special transitions include Christmas Snow and Autumn leaves. How do I add/remove the Random Quotes? If you want to add or remove quotes that show randomly on the portal and board indexes, edit the language/lang_english/quotes.txt file and any other language you may have installed. How do I add/remove Radio Stations? You can add and remove radio stations by editing the mods/radio/radio.xml file. Dictionary stops when trying to install it! With the spellcheck feature a user can spellcheck their posts and private messages before posting them. If the dictionary installation keeps stopping mid-way when you are trying to install it from Admin - General - SpellChecker, make sure the Force Safe Mode option is checked. Couldn \'t update private forum permissions! Could not delete group for this user! Couldn \'t delete auth access info! This is a known bug caused by phpBB Usergroups. However there is a fix for it, in the docs/scripts/ directory you will find a file user_usergroups_fix.php . How do I switch off the Prillian popups? From Admin - Prillian - Configuration - Override individual user settings, set this to Yes, find - Launch client automatically when logged in user visits forum index, and set this to No. This will disable Prillian without any user interaction required. What is the location of the Prillian sound file? When setting the location of the sound file you wish to use in the configuration panel for Prillian, it will always be relative to your phpBB directory so for example you create a directory for the sounds you wish to use with Prillian named mods/prillian/audio/ and upload your sounds to this directory, then enter into the Prillian configuration sound field, mods/prillian/audio/sound_filename.au. I can see the games area but what games can I download? Games can be downloaded from www.phpbb-amod.com . There you will find a huge selection that you can install for your users. How do I edit the FAQ? You can edit all the board and BBCode FAQ from Admin - Languages. Please make sure that the lang_faq.php and lang_bbcode.php files for the language you are attempting to edit have their permissions set to 0666 (or -rw-rw-rw-), or else you will not be able to change any FAQ.",24),array(15,"operate_hierarchies.html","2005-11-25","FULLY MODDED PHPBB 2 OFFICIAL DOCUMENTATION","","","How do I setup Hierarchies? Plan your forum layout first, because you do not want to be altering anything later, as some have reported losing their data when \'updating \' categories/forums. Get it right then leave alone. The hierarchies can be setup from Admin - Forums - Management and can be set to a depth of two levels. Category are the labels. Forums are where you post the messages. Example: Use the create new category button to first create the categories Test category 1 , and Test category 2 . Use the create new forum button to create the forums Test Forum 1 (#1) , and Test Sub Forum 1 (#2) . Now to create a sub-forum Test Forum 2 under the Test Sub Forum 1 forum. Create a new category Test sub category 1 , this allows the creation of a first sub-forum, Test Forum 2 (#3) (shown in pink). By repeating the action above, again a category first, Test sub sub category 1 , then a forum, Test Forum 3 (#4) , will create a second level sub-sub-forum (shown in green). When creating a forum use the category drop down list to choose which category to place the new forum under. Of course you can have as many forums under a category as you wish. How do I completely disable posting in the main forum when there are Sub-forums above it? The only way that this is possible is to restrict the main (holding) forum to ADMINs only.

With the lottery a member can buy a ticket and earn points if they win. You can set this up from Admin - Points System - Lottery: Configuration. You can switch the lottery on or off, give it a name, set up the price of a ticket (entry cost), the base amount, how long it takes to the next draw (lottery draw period), how many tickets a member can buy and if the process is supposed to restart or not. I \'m getting an error about rand not being seeded or something like that, what is this? It means the version of PHP on your webserver is out of date. Either update it or you can \'t use this modification, sorry. How is it drawn? Each visit to the lottery page it will check the time to see if it \'s over, if it is it will draw it and either reset it or turn it off depending on your settings. The new countdown will begin from then. Not from when the original timer ran out. This is because it \'s built in PHP and there \'s no such thing as timers. How do I set the time periods for it to be drawn? The Lottery Draw Periods is how long it will take for it to be drawn, in seconds. What is Auto-Restart? It means once the lottery has finished its current run, it will automatically reset itself and begin a new lot. What is Lottery Base Amount? It \'s what will be given no matter how many people enter. It \'s a base sum from which the total will begin. Basically, if you make it 500 and 1 person enters for 25 currency it will give them 525. What is Entry Cost? It \'s how much each entry into the lottery will cost. What is the Tickets field for in the admin panel control for the lottery? It will allow people to either enter once or as many times as they like into the lottery. Is it possible to stop the lottery? Yes, just turn it off, however if you do this and turn it back on the timer will restart. How do I get it to start? Turn it on in the admin panel, under lottery status, each time you turn it on it will restart the timer. Will updating the lottery settings reset the lottery? No, not unless you turn it off then back on. Can I force it to end? Yes, just change the period in which it \'s drawn. If you set it to 1 it will draw it instantly.

Functions used by more than page should be placed in functions.php, functions specific to one page should be placed on that page (at the top to maintain compatibility with PHP3) surrounded by comments indicating the start and end of the function block. All messages/errors should be output by the message_die function using the appropriate message type (see function for details). No attempt should be made to remove any copyright information (either contained within the source or displayed interactively when the source is run/compiled), neither should the copyright information be altered in any way (it may be added to). Editor Settings i. Tabs vs Spaces In order to make this as simple as possible, we will be using tabs, not spaces. Feel free to set how many spaces your editor uses when it displays tabs, but make sure that when you save the file, it \'s saving tabs and not spaces. This way, we can each have the code be displayed the way we like it, without breaking the layout of the actual files. ii. Linefeeds Ensure that your editor is saving files in the UNIX format. This means lines are terminated with a newline, not with a CR/LF combo as they are on Win32, or whatever the Mac uses. Any decent Win32 editor should be able to do this, but it might not always be the default. Know your editor. If you want advice on Windows text editors, just ask one of the developers. Some of them do their editing on Win32. Naming Conventions We will not be using any form of hungarian notation in our naming conventions. Many of us believe that hungarian naming is one of the primary code obfuscation techniques currently in use. i. Variable Names Variable names should be in all lowercase, with words separated by an underscore. Example: current_user is right, but currentuser and currentUser are not. Names should be descriptive, but concise. We don \'t want huge sentences as our variable names, but typing an extra couple of characters is always better than wondering what exactly a certain variable is for. ii. Loop Indices The only situation where a one-character variable name is allowed is when it \'s the index for some looping construct. In this case, the index of the outer loop should always be i. If there \'s a loop inside that loop, its index should be j, followed by k, and so on. If the loop is being indexed by some already-existing variable with a meaningful name, this guideline does not apply. Example:	for (i = 0; i &lt; outer_size; i++)	{ for (j = 0; j &lt; inner_size; j++) { foo(i, j); }	} iii. Function Names Functions should also be named descriptively. We \'re not programming in C here, we don \'t want to write functions called things like stristr(). Again, all lower-case names with words separated by a single underscore character. Function names should preferably have a verb in them somewhere. Good function names are print_login_status() , get_user_data() , etc.. iv. Function Arguments Arguments are subject to the same guidelines as variable names. We don \'t want a bunch of functions like: do_stuff(a, b, c) . In most cases, we \'d like to be able to tell how to use a function by just looking at its declaration. v. Summary The basic philosophy here is to not hurt code clarity for the sake of laziness. This has to be balanced by a little bit of common sense, though; print_login_status_for_a_given_user() goes too far, for example -- that function would be better named print_user_login_status() , or just print_login_status() . Code Layout i. Standard header for new files Here a template of the header that must be included at the start of all phpBB files: /*************************************************************************** * filename.php * ------------------- * begin : Saturday, June 17, 2000 * copyright : (C) 2000 The phpBB Group * email : support@phpbb.com * * Id: filename.php,v 1.0 2000/06/17 21:00:12 natec Exp * ***************************************************************************//*************************************************************************** * * This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by * the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or * (at your option) any later version. * ***************************************************************************/ ii. Always include the braces This is another case of being too lazy to type two (2) extra characters causing problems with code clarity. Even if the body of some construct is only one line long, do not drop the braces. Just don \'t. Examples:	/* These are all wrong. */	if (condition)	do_stuff();	if (condition)	do_stuff();	while (condition)	do_stuff();	for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)	do_stuff(i);	/* These are right. */	if (condition)	{	do_stuff();	}	while (condition)	{	do_stuff();	}	for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)	{	do_stuff();	} iii. Where to put the braces This one is a bit of a holy war, but we \'re going to use a style that can be summed up in one sentence: Braces always go on their own line. The closing brace should also always be at the same column as the corresponding opening brace. Examples:	if (condition)	{	while (condition2)	{	...	}	}	else	{	...	}	for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)	{	...	}	while (condition)	{	...	}	function do_stuff()	{	...	} iv. Use spaces between tokens This is another simple, easy step that helps keep code readable without much effort. Whenever you write an assignment, expression, etc.. Always leave one space between the tokens. Basically, write code as if it was English. Put spaces between variable names and operators. Don \'t put spaces just after an opening bracket or before a closing bracket. Don \'t put spaces just before a comma or a semicolon. This is best shown with a few examples. Examples:	/* Each pair shows the wrong way followed by the right way. */	i=0;	i = 0;	if(i&lt;7) ...	if (i &lt; 7) ...	if ( (i &lt; 7)&amp;&amp;(j &gt; 8) ) ...	if ((i &lt; 7) &amp;&amp; (j &gt; 8)) ...	do_stuff( i, foo, b );	do_stuff(i, foo, b);	for(i=0; i&lt;size; i++) ...	for(i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) ...	i=(j &lt; size)?0:1;	i = (j &lt; size) ? 0 : 1; v. Operator precedence Do you know the exact precedence of all the operators in PHP? Neither do I. Don \'t guess. Always make it obvious by using brackets to force the precedence of an equation so you know what it does. Examples:	/* what \'s the result? who knows. */	bool = (i &lt; 7 &amp;&amp; j &gt; 8 || k == 4);	/* now you can be certain what I \'m doing here. */	bool = ((i &lt; 7) &amp;&amp; ((j &lt; 8) || (k == 4))) vi. SQL code layout Since we \'ll all be using different editor settings, don \'t try to do anything complex like aligning columns in SQL code. Do, however, break statements onto their own lines. Here \'s a sample of how SQL code should look. Note where the lines break, the capitalization, and the use of brackets. Examples:	SELECT field1 AS something, field2, field3	FROM table a, table b	WHERE (this = that) AND (this2 = that2) vi. SQL insert statements SQL INSERT statements can be written in two different ways. Either you specify explicitly the columns being inserted, or you rely on knowing the order of the columns in the database and do not specify them. We want to use the former approach, where it is explicitly stated whcih columns are being inserted. This means our application-level code will not depend on the order of the fields in the database, and will not be broken if we add additional fields (unless they \'re specified as NOT NULL, of course). Examples:	# This is not what we want.	INSERT INTO mytable	VALUES ( \'something \', 1, \'else \')	# This is correct.	INSERT INTO mytable (column1, column2, column3)	VALUES ( \'something \', 1, \'else \') General Guidelines i. Quoting strings There are two different ways to quote strings in PHP - either with single quotes or with double quotes. The main difference is that the parser does variable interpolation in double-quoted strings, but not in single quoted strings. Because of this, you should always use single quotes unless you specifically need variable interpolation to be done on that string. This way, we can save the parser the trouble of parsing a bunch of strings where no interpolation needs to be done. Also, if you are using a string variable as part of a function call, you do not need to enclose that variable in quotes. Again, this will just make unnecessary work for the parser. Note, however, that nearly all of the escape sequences that exist for double-quoted strings will not work with single-quoted strings. Be careful, and feel free to break this guideline if it \'s making your code harder to read. Examples:	/* wrong */	str = This is a really long string with no variables for the parser to find.;	do_stuff(str);	/* right */	str = \'This is a really long string with no variables for the parser to find. \';	do_stuff(str); ii. Associative array keys In PHP, it \'s legal to use a literal string as a key to an associative array without quoting that string. We don \'t want to do this -- the string should always be quoted to avoid confusion. Note that this is only when we \'re using a literal, not when we \'re using a variable. Examples:	/* wrong */	foo = assoc_array[blah];	/* right */	foo = assoc_array[ \'blah \']; iii. Comments Each function should be preceded by a comment that tells a programmer everything they need to know to use that function. The meaning of every parameter, the expected input, and the output are required as a minimal comment. The function \'s behaviour in error conditions (and what those error conditions are) should also be present. Nobody should have to look at the actual source of a function in order to be able to call it with confidence in their own code. In addition, commenting any tricky, obscure, or otherwise not-immediately-obvious code is clearly something we should be doing. Especially important to document are any assumptions your code makes, or preconditions for its proper operation. Any one of the developers should be able to look at any part of the application and figure out what \'s going on in a reasonable amount of time. iv. Magic numbers Don \'t use them. Use named constants for any literal value other than obvious special cases. Basically, it \'s OK to check if an array has 0 elements by using the literal 0. It \'s not OK to assign some special meaning to a number and then use it everywhere as a literal. This hurts readability AND maintainability. Included in this guideline is that we should be using the constants TRUE and FALSE in place of the literals 1 and 0 -- even though they have the same values, it \'s more obvious what the actual logic is when you use the named constants. v. Shortcut operators The only shortcut operators that cause readability problems are the shortcut increment (i++) and decrement (j--) operators. These operators should not be used as part of an expression. They can, however, be used on their own line. Using them in expressions is just not worth the headaches when debugging. Examples:	/* wrong */	array[++i] = j;	array[i++] = k;	/* right */	i++;	array[i] = j;	array[i] = k;	i++; vi. Inline conditionals Inline conditionals should only be used to do very simple things. Preferably, they will only be used to do assignments, and not for function calls or anything complex at all. They can be harmful to readability if used incorrectly, so don \'t fall in love with saving typing by using them. Examples:	/* Bad place to use them */	((i &lt; size) &amp;&amp; (j &gt; size)) ? do_stuff(foo) : do_stuff(bar);	/* OK place to use them */	min = (i &lt; j) ? i : j; vii. Don \'t use uninitialized variables Don \'t use uninitialized variables for phpBB 2, we intend to use a higher level of run-time error reporting. This will mean that the use of an uninitialized variable will be reported as an error. This will come up most often when checking which HTML form variables were passed. These errors can be avoided by using the built-in isset() function to check whether a variable has been set. Examples:	/* Old way */	if (forum) ...	/* New way */	if (isset(forum)) ...

The server administrator can control which available directives (if any) are allowed to be set in a .htaccess file on a directory-by-directory basis. If allowed, directives can affect the current directory and those below it. .htaccess files can contain PHP directives prefixed by php_flag or php_value . The .htaccess file can also be used to set an AddType directive that can change the extension associated by the server with PHP documents. abstract class A class that is partially implemented and explicitly declared as such. Unimplemented methods are declared abstract and consist of method signatures only. Classes that extend abstract classes must implement all abstract methods or be declared abstract themselves. anonymous function A function that is created on-the-fly during script execution and stored in a variable or passed to other functions. argument A value passed to a function or method. Arguments are included within the parentheses of a function call. User-defined functions include comma-separated argument names within the parentheses of the function definition. These arguments then become available to the function as local variables. array A list variable. That is, a variable that contains multiple elements indexed by numbers or strings. It enables you to store, order, and access many values under one name. An array is a data type. associative array An array indexed by strings. atom With reference to regular expressions an atom is a pattern enclosed in parentheses (often referred to as a subpattern). After you have defined an atom, you can treat it as if it were itself a character or character class. Boolean A data type. Booleans can contain one of the special values true or false . bounds The number of times a character or range of characters should be matched in a regular expression. break statement Consists of the keyword break. It forces the immediate end of a for or while loop iteration, and no further iterations of the loop take place. cast The process by which one data type is converted to another. class A collection of special functions called methods and special variables called properties . You can declare a class with the class keyword. Classes are the templates from which objects are created. color resource A special value of the data type resource . It is returned by the imagecolorallocate() function and passed to other image manipulation functions, which can then work with the specified color. comment Text in a script that is ignored by the interpreter. Comments can be used to make code more readable or to annotate a script. comparison operator In the form ==, this operator compares two operands and tests for equivalence. It resolves to the Boolean true value if the two operands are equivalent and false otherwise. In the form ===, the operator tests two object variables, returning true only if both variables are references to the same object. constant Outside of a class, a constant is a value that is set with the define() function and does not change throughout the execution of a script. A constant is global in scope and can be only a number or string. In the context of a class, a constant is a special property declared with the const keyword. A constant property cannot be changed at runtime and is available via the class rather than a class instance. constructor A special method that is automatically called when an object is instantiated. continue statement Consists of the keyword continue . It forces the immediate end of the current for or while loop iteration. Execution begins again from the test expression (in for loops the modification expression is executed first) and the next loop iteration is begun if the expression resolves to true . conversion specification Contained within a format control string, a conversion specification begins with a percent (%) symbol and defines how to treat the corresponding argument to printf() or sprintf() . You can include as many conversion specifications as you want within the format control string, as long as you send an equivalent number of arguments to printf() . cookie A small amount of data stored by the user \'s browser in compliance with a request from a server or script. data type Different types of data take up different amounts of memory and behave in different ways when operated on. A data type is the named means by which these different kinds of data are distinguished. PHP has eight data types: integer, double, string, Boolean, object, array, resource, and NULL. DBA Database abstraction layer. These functions are designed to provide a common interface to a range of file-based database systems. DBA resource A special value of the data type resource . It is returned by the dba_open() function and passed to other DBA functions, which can then work with the open database. DBM Database manager. DBM and DBM-like systems enable you to store and manipulate name/value pairs on your system. destructor A special method automatically invoked just before an object is removed from memory. document object model (DOM) A means of accessing an XML document that involves the generation of a tree of nodes organized as parents, children, and siblings. document type definition (DTD) A set of rules that determines which XML elements can be used in which order for an XML document. A validating XML parser reads a DTD and enforces the rules it describes. double A data type. Also known as a float, a floating-point number, or a real number, a double is defined by The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing as a number representation consisting of a mantissa [the part after the decimal point], ... an exponent, ... and an (assumed) radix (or base). For the purposes of this book, you can think of a double as a number that can contain a fraction of a whole numberthat is, a number with a decimal point. else statement It can be used only in the context of an if statement. The else statement consists of the keyword else and a statement (or series of statements). These statements are executed only if the test expression of the associated if statement evaluates to false . entity body The substance of a document returned by a server to a client. An entity body can also be sent by a client to a server as part of a POST request . escape The practice of removing special significance from characters within strings or regular expressions by preceding them with a backslash character ( \\). exception A special object that can be thrown by a method with the throw keyword. An exception object must be of type Exception and includes a message and other error information. Throwing an exception causes a method \'s execution to end. The calling code is then responsible for handling the exception using the catch keyword. expression Any combination of functions, values, and operators that resolves to a value. As a rule of thumb, if you can use it as if it were a value, it is an expression. field width specifier Contained within a conversion specification, a field width specifier determines the space within which output should be formatted. file resource A special value of the data type resource . It is returned by the fopen() function and passed to other file functions, which can then work with the open file. float A data type. It is a synonym for double. for statement A loop that can initialize a counter variable (initialization expression), test a counter variable (test expression), and modify a counter variable (modification expression) on a single line. As long as the test expression evaluates to true , the loop statement continues to be executed. foreach statement A loop used to iterate through every element in an array. The loop automatically populates temporary variables with the next array key and values for each iteration. format control string The first argument to printf() or sprintf() . It contains conversion specifications that determine the way in which additional arguments to these functions are formatted. Freetype An open-source library providing functionality for working with TrueType fonts. The two versions are FreeType 1 and FreeType 2. Both libraries can be used by PHP \'s image functions to render text in images. function A block of code that is not immediately executed but can be called by your scripts when needed. Functions can be built-in or user-defined. They can require information to be passed to them and usually return a value. GET request A request made to a server by a client in which additional information can be sent appended to the URL. global Consists of the keyword global followed by a variable(s). It causes the associated variables to be accessed in global rather than local scope. header section Part of an HTTP request or response (it follows the request line or response line). It consists of name/value pairs on separate lines. Names are separated from values by colons. hint The name of an object type used to qualify an argument in a method declaration. When the method is invoked, it must be passed an object of the defined type for that argument; otherwise, the script fails. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) A set of rules that defines the process by which a client sends a request and a server returns a response. if statement Consists of a test expression and a statement or series of statements. The statement is executed only if the test expression evaluates to true . image resource A special value of the data type resource . It is returned by the imagecreate() function and passed to other image manipulation functions, which can then work with the dynamic image. inheritance A term used in the context of object-oriented programming. It is used to describe the process by which one class is set up to include the member variables and methods of another. This is achieved using the extends keyword when the child class is declared. integer A data type. Integers include all whole negative and positive numbers and zero. iteration A single execution of a statement (or series of statements) associated with a loop. A loop that executes five times has five iterations. interface A special class that contains only method signatures. An interface must contain no implementation at all. Classes that implement an interface must implement every method it defines. A class can implement any number of interfaces and takes on the type of any interface it implements. link resource A special value of the data type resource . It is returned by the mysql_connect() function and passed to other MySQL functions, which can then work with the open database. method A special function, available only in the context of a class or object. multidimensional array An array that contains another array as one of its elements. NULL A special data type. It consists of the value NULL and represents an uninitialized variablethat is, a variable that holds no value. object Existing in memory rather than as code, an object is an instance of a class, meaning it \'s the working embodiment of the functionality laid down in a class. An object is instantiated with the new statement in conjunction with the name of the class of which it is to be a member. When an object is instantiated, you can access all its properties and all its methods. An object is a data type. operand A value used in conjunction with an operator. There are usually two operands to one operator. operator A symbol or series of symbols that, when used in conjunction with values, performs an action and usually produces a new value. padding specifier Contained within a conversion specification, a padding specifier determines the number of characters that output should occupy and the characters to add otherwise. pattern modifier A letter placed after the final delimiter in Perlcompatible regular expressions to refine their behavior. PEAR The PHP Extension and Application Repository. A qualitycontrolled library of PHP packages designed to extend the usefulness of PHP. PEAR::Auth A PEAR package that provides methods for authenticating visitors using usernames and passwords. PEAR::Config A PEAR package for writing to and reading from configuration files. PEAR::DB A PEAR package that provides a common interface for talking to many databases. php.ini The configuration file that determines the way in which PHP runs. The file contains directives that specify a wide range of rules and behaviors. phpDocumentor A package for producing documentation using comments embedded in source code. It \'s part of PEAR. POST request A request made to a server by a client in which additional information can be sent within the request entity body. precision specifier Contained within a conversion specification, a precision specifier determines the number of decimal places to which a double should be rounded. private This keyword limits the availability of a method or property to the enclosing class only. property A special variable, available only in the context of an object or a class. protected This keyword limits the availability of a method or property to the enclosing class and to any child classes. public This keyword makes a property or method available to any client code. query string A set of name/value pairs appended to a URL as part of a GET request. Names are separated from values by equal signs, and pairs are separated from each other by ampersand (&) characters. The query string is separated from the rest of the URL by a question mark (?). Both names and values are encoded so characters with significance to the server are not present. reference The means by which multiple variables can point to the same value. By default, nonobject arguments are passed and assignments are made by value in PHP. This means that copies of values are passed around. As of PHP 5, objects are assigned and passed by reference. Therefore, when you pass an object variable to a method, you pass a handle to a single object, as opposed to a copy of the object. regular expression A powerful way of examining and modifying text. request headers Key value pairs sent to the server by a client providing information about the client itself and the nature of the request. request line The first line of a client request to a server. It consists of a request method, typically GET , HEAD , or POST ; the address of the document required; and the HTTP version to be used (HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1). resource A special data type. Resources represent handles used to work with external entities (databases and files are good examples of this). response headers Key value pairs sent to the client in response to a request. They provide information about the server environment and the data that is being served. scope The range of code for which a variable holds a particular value. For example, the value of a variable declared inside a function is unavailable outside that function. The variable is said to be local to the scope of the function. server variables Predefined elements that PHP makes available for you in conjunction with your server. You can access these elements via the superglobal _SERVER array. Which elements are made available is server dependent, but they are likely to include common variables such as _SERVER[ \'HTTP_USER_AGENT \'] and _SERVER[ \'REMOTE_ADDR \'] . statement Represents an instruction to the interpreter. Broadly, it is to PHP what a sentence is to written or spoken English. A sentence should end with a period; a statement should usually end with a semicolon. Exceptions to this include statements that enclose other statements and statements that end a block of code. In most cases, however, failure to end a statement with a semicolon confuses the interpreter and results in an error. static Used within the context of a function, the static keyword ensures that an associated variable maintains the same value across function calls. In the context of a class, a static property is available via a class rather than through individual class instances (objects). status line The first server response to a client request. The status line consists of the HTTP version the server is using (HTTP/1.0 or HTTP/1.1), a response code, and a text message that clarifies the meaning of the response code. stream A flow of data that can be read from and written to. Streams are a new mechanism in PHP that provide a common interface for working with data across a range of contexts. string A data type. It is a series of characters. Structured Query Language (SQL) A standardized syntax by which different types of database can be queried. subclass A class that inherits member variables and methods from another (parent) class. superclass A parent class. superglobal A variable available in any scope. Superglobals are always built-in and include _REQUEST , _GET , _POST , and _SERVER , among others. switch A statement that compares the result of an operation against any number of different values in turn, executing a particular block of code if a match is found for the test value. ternary operator Returns a value derived from one of two expressions separated by a colon. Which expression is used to generate the value returned depends on the result of an initial test expression that precedes the return expressions and is separated from them by a question mark (?). timestamp The number of seconds that have elapsed since midnight GMT on January 1, 1970. This number is used in date arithmetic. type specifier Contained within a conversion specification, a type specifier determines the data type that should be output. variable A holder for a type of data. It can hold numbers, strings of characters, objects, arrays, or booleans. The contents of a variable can be changed at any time. while statement A loop that consists of a test expression and a statement (or series of statements). The statements are repeatedly executed as long as the test expression evaluates to true . XML (Extensible Markup Language) A set of rules for defining and parsing markup languages. Such languages are often constructed to structure data for sharing, format data for display, or send instructions to an interpreter. XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) A template system for XML documents that makes converting from XML to other formats, such as HTML or WML, easy.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation \'s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software. Also, for each author \'s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors \' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone \'s free use or not licensed at all. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The Program, below, refers to any such program or work, and a work based on the Program means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term modification.) Each licensee is addressed as you. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program \'s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)	The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients \' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and any later version, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Follow the steps below and you \'ll have a new theme on your board within minutes. This tutorial will help you create your own styles so that they are compatible with Fully Modded phpBB 2. Each section is split in to sub sections. To make a new style you will need a few tools to make the job easier, we recommend the following: Text Editor - e.g. WordPad, EmEditor , or PHP Coder . Graphics Program - e.g. Adobe Photoshop , Paintshop Pro , Gimp , or Fireworks (Photoshop is highly recommended). i. Renaming &amp; Editing Files First, make a copy of the subSilver/ directory located in the templates/ directory. Make sure the subSilver directory that you copy is in its \' original state and has not been modified or altered at all. If you are not sure of this, then I suggest downloading it again to be safe. Copy the subSilver/ directory into the templates/ directory creating a duplicate (it should be called \'Copy of subSilver \'). Rename the copied directory to whatever your new template name is going to be, for this example our theme will be named FullyModded . Next, we need to rename the two (2) main style files, the stylesheet and the image configuration file. subSilver.cfg rename to FullyModded.cfg subSilver.css rename to FullyModded.css Next, we need to edit four (4) files in the new FullyModded/ directory and find all references of \'subSilver \', changing them all to our new template name, \'FullyModded \'. If you have a find and replace tool this is a good time to use it; you must replace \'subSilver \' with your new template name, e.g. FullyModded. prillian/prefs_tabs.tpl FullyModded.css radio.php theme_info.cfg Note: Replace the word \'FullyModded \' with your actual template name. Directory name and all filenames are case sensitive, so \'FullyModded \', \'Fullymodded \', \'fullyModded \', and \'fullymodded \' are not the same and when following the renaming instructions above you should make sure you have correct filename case everywhere. ii. Image Creation Creating any extra images for your new style can be an easy process providing you have the right software. To create images you can either: Download the subSilver SDK from phpBB and change the colours of the images. Use a software package such as Adobe Photoshop and make you own images based on what you want your style to look like. iii. Changing the Layout Changing the layout of your style can be very complex or very easy depending on how much you know about HTML and css. You could seperate the categories which are shown here or you could make your own header. The best way to this is in Dreamweaver by using these steps: Open a blank HTML document and erase everything in the code section. Open \'templates/FullyModded/overall_header.tpl \' and copy what \'s in it and paste it in the code section on the blank HTML document. Open \'templates/FullyModded/index_body.tpl \' and copy what \'s in it and paste it below the overall_header code in the code section on the blank HTML document. Open \'templates/FullyModded/overall_footer.tpl \' and copy what \'s in it and paste it below the index_body code in the code section on the blank HTML document. Go back to the HTML document and right-click on the design view, then goto CSS Styles, then Attach Style Sheet, then find your-new-template-name.css and attach it to your document, then find formIE.css and attach that to your document. Now you should be able to see how your style looks like now it has the css on it. iv. Viewing Finished Products Login as an Administrator, go to Admin - Styles &amp; Templates - Add New. If you see your new style in the list of available styles to install then you did everything correctly. You can install the style and edit it. If you don \'t see your new style in that list then you did something incorrectly (probably forgot to edit theme_info.cfg or forgot to rename subSilver.cfg ) Or, you could install both an Apache server and Fully Modded phpBB locally on your machine and have a live view of you style or you could view it the Dreamweaver way which is stated above.

Our thanks to all those people who \'ve converted themes, beta tested, contributed bug reports and code fixes in the past. Template- make_filename(): Error - file does not exist! This error is usually caused by a template file that has not uploaded to your server correctly, and as such is missing or incomplete. This error can also be caused by trying to use a theme that is not compatible with your Fully Modded version. Re-upload the missing file again, or please check the themes that you are using are compatible with the version of Fully Modded phpBB that you are using. Can I install/use phpBB 2 themes? You can not use alternative phpBB templates for Fully Modded, you should note they will not function correctly with your Fully Modded phpBB board. It is therefore recommended you only use themes available on our website that are compatible with the version that you are using.
