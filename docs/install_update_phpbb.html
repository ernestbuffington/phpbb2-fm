<h1 class="h2"><u>Update from phpBB version</u></h1>
<p>If you are currently using phpBB updating to Fully Modded phpBB is generally quite easy if you follow the steps below. First you should make a copy of your existing <u>config.php</u> and keep it in a safe place!</p> 
<p>You can leave alternative templates in-place but you should note they <u>will not</u> function correctly with Fully Modded phpBB. It is therefore recommended you switch back to subSilver if you are currently using a different style (Override all of your users too), then un-install any extra themes you may have added. More details about compatible themes is discussed <a href="install_post.html#themes">Here</a>.</p>  

<h3 class="h3">i. Preparing the Directory Structure</h3>
<p>You need to create and move some existing directories containing uploaded files to their new locations.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>CREATE</b> a new directory in your forum root directory named <u>uploads/user_avatars</u></li>
	<li><b>MOVE</b> all user uploaded avatars (usually stored in the <u>images/avatars</u> directory) to the new <u>uploads/user_avatars</u> directory</li>
	<li><b>MOVE</b> any avatar gallery directories in the <u>images/avatars/gallery</u> directory up to the <u>images/avatars</u> directory, then <b>DELETE</b> the <u>images/avatars/gallery</u> directory</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="h3">ii. Preparing the File Structure</h3>
<p>Next, delete <b>ALL</b> the existing phpBB files from your forum root directory, <b>EXCEPT</b> for the following listed below, do not leave any other files in place otherwise you may encounter errors later.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Keep the <u>cache/</u> directory</li>
	<li>Keep the <u>images/avatars/</u> directory</li>
	<li>Keep the <u>images/smiles/</u> directory</li>
	<li>Keep the <u>uploads/</u> directory</li>
</ul>
<p>With this complete you can upload the new Fully Modded phpBB files (see <a href="install_new.html">New Installation</a> for details if necessary). Once complete copy back your saved <u>config.php</u>, replacing the new one.</p>

<h3 class="h3">iii. Executing the Update</h3>
<p>Your board will now be disabled.</p>
<p>You should now execute the file <u>install/update_to_latest.php</u> from your browser which will make a number of database changes. You may receive <u>FAILURES</u> during this procedure, they should not be a cause for concern unless you see an actual <u>ERROR</u>, in which case the script will stop.</p>
<p>Once the update process has completed click <a href="install_post.html">Here</a> to complete the update.</p>
