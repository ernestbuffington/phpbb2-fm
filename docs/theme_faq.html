<h1 class="h2"><u>Theme FAQ</u></h1>
<p>This is a very basic Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section which attempts to answer some of the more commonly asked theme questions. Our thanks to all those people who've converted themes, beta tested, contributed bug reports and code fixes in the past.</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Template->make_filename(): Error - file does not exist!</b></li>
	<p>This error is usually caused by a template file that has not uploaded to your server correctly, and as such is missing or incomplete. This error can also be caused by trying to use a theme that is not compatible with your Fully Modded version. Re-upload the missing file again, or please check the themes that you are using are compatible with the version of Fully Modded phpBB that you are using.</p>
	
	<li><b>Can I install/use phpBB 2 themes?</b></li>
	<p>You <u>can not</u> use alternative phpBB templates for Fully Modded, you should note they <u>will not</u> function correctly with your Fully Modded phpBB board. It is therefore recommended you only use themes available on our website that are compatible with the version that you are using. Themes downloaded from 3rd party sites are not supported by us.</p>
