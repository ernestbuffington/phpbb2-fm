<h1 class="h2"><u>How do the Shops work?</u></h1>
<p>In the shop the member can buy effects or other inputed items. The Administrator can switch the Effect Shop on and create additional shops from Admin -> Points System -> Shop: Configuration. In the Effect or Special Shop the member can buy privileges like using an avatar or a signature, and colors for their name and titles.The Administrator can add items to the additional shops with a name, long and short description, a price, a stock and a maximum stock.</p>

<ol>
	<li><b>I just cant get item images to appear!</b>
	<p>This can be caused by a few things. First, the shop only allows .gif and .jpg images at the moment, all images must be placed in the <u>images/shop/</u> directory. Next, make sure if they're not showing in profiles or on threads, that you have the options set to images and not links from Admin -> Points System -> Shop: Configuration.</p>
	<p>Lastly, one of the more common mistakes, make sure the images are named <b>EXACTLY</b> the same as the item (this is case sensitive). For example, apple must have an apple.jpg image (or .gif). Apple will not work with apple.gif.</p></li>
		
	<li><b>How do you add an item? </b>
	<p>From Admin -> Points System -> Shop: Configuration update the Shop you wish to add the Item to.</p></li>
	
	<li><b>Does removing a shop delete all the items from the users who own them? </b>
	<p>Yes, if your forum is rather large, it's probably not a good idea to do this while it's busy as it does take quite a few large loops to complete. </p></li>
	
	<li><b>What does Restocking do? </b>
	<p>This setting increases the Item stock until it reaches the maximum amount, every amount of time specified by an Admin. </p></li>

	<li><b>What does Multiple Item Buying do? </b>
	<p>This setting allows your users to buy more than one of each Item. </p></li>
	
	<li><b>What does Viewtopic Type do? </b>
	<p>This is a setting to allow you to disable images while viewing topics. It's mainly there so users with huge amounts of items don't flood your forum's screens. 'Link' just leaves the link to their "Inventory", 'Images' leaves the link and images.</p></li>

	<li><b>What does Selling Rate do? </b>
	<p>This setting changes the amount users are given back when returning/selling an Item. This is in percent. 100% is a full refund. </p></li>
	
	<li><b>How do I make the Effects Shop work? </b>
	<p>From Admin -> Points System -> Shop: Configuration, click on the Edit button next to Special Shop and enable it.</p></li>
	
	<li><b>What is the Access Forum field for? </b>
	<p>It allows you to set up private forums that can only be accessed when a user owns a certain item. Make sure view/post/read/edit are all set to PRIVATE if you want to make use of this feature. </p></li>
