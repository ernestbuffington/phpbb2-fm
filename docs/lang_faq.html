<h1 class="h2"><u>Language FAQ</u></h1>
<p>This is a very basic Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section which attempts to answer some of the more commonly asked language questions. Our thanks to all those people who've translated languages, beta tested, contributed bug reports and code fixes in the past.</p>
<ol>
	<a name="faq1"></a><li><b>My users are complaining that emails are not in their selected language!</b></li>
	<p>You must have deleted a language pack or the language pack is incomplete. phpBB will try to send emails in the users selected language. If it cannot find a suitable email template it will switch to the boards default language.</p>

	<a name="faq2"></a><li><b>Why do I have to translate my language? Why doesn't the support staff do it?</b></li>
	<p>Great question! We'll ask one in return...Can you put an extra twelve (12) hours in the day? We are all volunteering our time and energy for this free package. Part of the problem is how big Fully Modded phpBB now is...the scope of this project leaves us very little time for anything beyond troubleshooting broken mods or cleaning up after lazy mod owners to make this package function properly. We simply don't have time and are not multilingual! It would make more sense for someone fluent in the language to make the language pack!</p>
	<p>If we had a smaller piece of software, we'd probably be able to help you. But it would mean a great deal to all of us if you took the initiative and contributed your special knowledge to Fully Modded phpBB for the benefit of others.</p>
