<h1 class="h2"><u>Database Backup for Beginners</u></h1>
<p>You need to do a forum backup, and yes you need do do it now, put it off and it may be to late!</p>
<ol>
	<li>Login to your cPanel and go to your "<b>phpMyAdmin</b>" section.</li>
	<li>Select your database (if you have more than one).</li>
	<li>Once loaded, click on the "<b>Export</b>" tab at the top of the page.</li>
	<li>Under the Export table you will see a large box showing either the database name (if so just highlight), or a list of tables starting with phpbb_ , make sure the <b>SQL</b> input button is chosen, and click on "<b>Select All</b>" which will highlight all tables.</li>
	<li>Under the SQL Options table (in the bottom Data section) tick the "<b>Complete inserts</b>" checkbox.</li>	
	<li>Under the Structure table (which should be auto-checked) you will see a "<b>ADD DROP TABLE</b>" checkbox which you should also tick.</li>
	<li>Near the bottom of the page tick the "<b>Save as file</b>" checkbox.</li>
	<li>If you would like to compress the file into a zipped/gzipped format select so, and click "<b>Go</b>".</li>
	<li>You will then get a normal popup save window, where you should select "Save to disk".</li>
</ol>
<p>Easy! The database backup is created, the advantage is that you have the file on your hard-drive, and will be able to check if it's complete. If it's less than 8 MB, you know something has gone wrong, so just try again.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open your backup file in a text editor and scroll to the bottom.</li>
	<li>The last thing you should see is the "<b>phpbb_words</b>" table dumping data, if it is you know your backup is completely successful.</p>
	<table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" align="center">
	<tr>
		<td class="code2">--<br /> 
-- Dumping data for table `phpbb_words`<br />
--</td>
	</tr>
