<a name="ii"></a><h1 class="h2"><u>Change Welcome PM message</u></h1> 
<p>To change the Welcome PM that new users receive when they first register you will need to edit <u>language/lang_english/lang_main.php</u>. Use the code <b>%s</b> to show the sitename.</p>
<p>Find the lines:</p>
	<table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" align="center">
	<tr>
		<td class="code2">$lang['register_pm_subject'] = 'Welcome to %s';<br />

<a name="iii"></a><h1 class="h2"><u>Adding a Custom Portal block</u></h1> 
<p>To add a hardcoded HTML Portal block to any side of your portal, edit the <u>templates/subSilver/portal_body.tpl</u> template, use the following code in green as your block template. This code should be added between any exising blocks as shown in the example.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" align="center">
	<tr>
		<td class="code2"><span style="color: #FF0000">&lt;!-- ------------END OF ONE PACKAGED BLOCK------------- --&gt;</span><br /><br />&lt;table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="1" width="{COLUMN_WIDTH}" class="forumline"&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tr><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td class="catHead"&gt;&lt;span class="cattitle"&gt;CustomBlockTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;tr&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td class="row1"&gt;&lt;span class="gensmall"&gt;CustomBlockText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />&lt;/table&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br /><br /><span style="color: #FF0000">&lt;!-- ------------START OF ANOTHER PACKAGED BLOCK------------- --&gt;</span></td>
</tr>

<a name="iv"></a><h1 class="h2"><u>Increasing File Upload Limit</u></h1> 
<p>Most servers appear to have a 2MB upload limit set in php.ini (this has no affect on protocols like FTP) but does affect the pafiledb & attachment systems on Fully Modded phpBB.</p>
<p>If you don't have access to your php.ini file (shared hosting, etc) then open your <u>.htaccess</u> file (found in your forum root directory) and add the following code:</p>
<table width="90%" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="4" align="center">
<tr>
	<td class="code2">
	php_flag "upload_max_filesize" 5M
	</td>
</tr>
</table><br />
<p>Change <b>5</b> to whatever you want, but remember, that http is not the best protocol for uploading large files so don't set it too high.</p>
